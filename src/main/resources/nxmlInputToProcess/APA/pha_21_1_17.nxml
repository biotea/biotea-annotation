<abstract xml:lang="en">
<p align="left">This study builds on research identifying deficits in behavioral self-regulation as risk factors for intimate partner violence (IPV). It also builds on alcohol administration research identifying these deficits as moderators of the association between acute alcohol consumption and aggression in laboratory paradigms. Participants analyzed were 97 men seeking residential treatment for alcohol dependence who were involved in a current or recent heterosexual relationship of at least 1 year. Participants completed a self-report measure of impulsivity, neuropsychological tests of executive function, and computerized delay discounting and behavioral inhibition tasks. With the exception of the self-report measure of impulsivity, performance on measures of behavioral self-regulation was not associated with the occurrence or frequency of past year IPV in this sample. Similarly, self-reported impulsivity moderated the association between daily drinking and IPV in multivariate models controlling for daily drug use, but deficits in performance on other measures did not. Performance on a tower task moderated the association between daily drinking and the occurrence of IPV, but contrary to hypotheses, better task performance was associated with greater likelihood of IPV on drinking days. These results suggest that self-perceived impulsivity is a better predictor of IPV in alcohol treatment seeking men than deficits in performance on behavioral measures of delay discounting, behavioral inhibition, and executive function.</p>

<p align="left">Heavy drinking and alcohol use disorders are robust risk factors for male-to-female intimate partner violence (IPV; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-1" rid="c72">Leonard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1" rid="c54">Schumacher, Feldbau-Kohn, Slep, &amp; Heyman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-1" rid="c79">Stith, Smith, Penn, Ward, &amp; Tritt, 2004</xref>). Thus, it is not surprising that the 1-year prevalence of male-to-female IPV perpetration in substance abuse treatment samples is 58%85% (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-1" rid="c62">Stuart, O'Farrell, &amp; Temple, 2009</xref>), compared with 5.2%&#8211;13.6% in the U.S. married and cohabiting population (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">Schafer, Caetano, &amp; Clark, 1998</xref>). However, it is important to note that despite the well-established increased risk for IPV associated with heavy drinking and alcohol use disorders, most men who drink heavily do so without ever aggressing against a romantic partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">Kantor &amp; Straus, 1987</xref>). This is consistent with a growing body of research suggesting that an adequate explanation of alcohol-related violence, including IPV, will rely on the identification of relevant individual difference variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Higley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">Leonard, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Studies examining differences between men in alcohol treatment samples with and without a pretreatment year history of IPV perpetration have identified a variety of variables that distinguish these two groups, including the following: antisocial personality features, substance use problem severity, arrest history, and family history of alcoholism (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Bennett, Tolman, Rogalski, &amp; Srinivasaraghavan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Gondolf &amp; Foster, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Murphy &amp; O'Farrell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">Murphy, O'Farrell, Fals-Stewart, &amp; Feehan, 2001</xref>). Although these studies identify characteristics associated with IPV in alcohol treatment populations, they do not provide a clear explanation of how or why risk for IPV is heightened in these populations.</p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Giancola (2000)</xref> proposed a conceptual framework for alcohol-related aggression in which executive functioning (EF) serves as both a mediator and moderator of alcohol-related aggression. EF refers broadly to the putative functions of the frontal lobes, such as initiation, self-regulation, self-monitoring, and planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr73-1" rid="c73">Lezak, Howieson, &amp; Loring, 2004</xref>). Within the <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-2" rid="c28">Giancola (2000)</xref> framework, EF mediates this association in that acute alcohol intoxication disrupts EF. EF also moderates this association in that the acute effects of alcohol on aggression are more pronounced in those who are low in EF and diminished in those who are high in EF. Research combining alcohol-administration and laboratory aggression paradigms has supported this model in healthy social drinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Giancola, 2004</xref>), and a recent study found that a &#8220;Behavioral Regulation Index&#8221; comprising inhibition, emotional control, flexible thinking, and self-monitoring was the best predictor of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">Giancola, Godlaski, &amp; Roth, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Behavioral regulation, EF, and related constructs have been identified as important predictors of both substance use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Bickel &amp; Marsch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Fals-Stewart &amp; Bates, 2003</xref>) and aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Giancola, 1995</xref>). Many of the measures of behavioral self-regulation that have received attention in the substance abuse literature, such as delay-discounting tasks, have received comparatively little attention in the aggression literature. However, as research using these tasks emerges, the findings are generally consistent with the conclusion that diminished behavioral self-regulation is associated with aggression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">Cherek, Moeller, Dougherty, &amp; Rhoades, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">The association between EF and IPV specifically has been a focus of increasing research attention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-1" rid="c66">Walling, Meehan, Marshall, Holtzworth-Munroe, &amp; Taft, 2011</xref>). In studies comparing controls with men who were court-ordered to batterer treatment or had a history of domestic violence arrest, deficits in EF relative to controls are generally evident. The most commonly administered measures of EF in these studies are the Trails B test (which measures the ability to initiate, switch, and stop sequence of complex purposive behavior), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (which measures the ability to abstract and shift cognitive sets), and the Stroop Color-Word Test (which measures the ability to inhibit overlearned response and maintain a cognitive set). Although the literature generally supports differences between groups on these measures of EF (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Cohen, Rosenbaum, Kane, Warnken, &amp; Benjamin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-1" rid="c63">Teichner, Golden, Van Hasselt, &amp; Peterson, 2001</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-1" rid="c67">Westby and Ferraro (1999)</xref> found differences on Trails B, but not on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test or the Stroop Color-Word Test. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-2" rid="c13">Cohen et al. (1999)</xref>s also observed differences on Digit Symbol (which is a commonly used measure of EF that also assesses processing speed).</p>
<p align="left">More mixed findings for the association of EF and IPV emerge when men without IPV-related criminal justice involvement are studied. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-2" rid="c66">Walling et al. (2011)</xref> found that partner-violent men recruited from the community showed deficits relative to controls on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, but not Trails B or the Symbol Digit Modalities Test. In a study of treatment-seeking men with alcohol dependence, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Easton, Sacco, Neavins, Wupperman, and George (2008)</xref> found that men with and without a history of IPV did not differ on EF or impulsivity tasks. In contrast, in a study of men recovering from substance abuse recruited through community advertisements, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-1" rid="c52">Schafer and Fals-Stewart (1997)</xref> found differences on Stroop, Trails B, and the Booklet Category Test (which measures the ability to abstract and shift cognitive sets), but not Digit Symbol. In sum, while there is evidence for differences in EF in male IPV perpetrators compared with controls, particularly perpetrators with criminal justice involvement, findings in the literature have been inconsistent and incomplete. No measure of EF has consistently emerged as a predictor of IPV across all studies, and much of the previous research has focused on measures of EF that assess the ability to maintain and shift cognitive sets. Little is known about how other aspects of EF such as verbal fluency and planning may be related to IPV.</p>
<p align="left">Research that examines self-report measures of impulsivity as predictors of IPV suggests that the relationship between self-reported impulsivity and IPV is also complex and nuanced. For example, in a community sample, the relationship between husband self-reported impulsivity and psychological IPV was mediated by substance abuse and marital dissatisfaction. The relationships between substance abuse and marital dissatisfaction and husband physical IPV were mediated, in turn, by psychological IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-1" rid="c61">Stuart &amp; Holtzworth-Munroe, 2005</xref>). In an undergraduate sample, self-reported urgency emerged as an important predictor of IPV, whereas other aspects of self-reported impulsivity, sensation seeking and lack of premeditation, predicted general violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Derefinko, DeWall, Metze, Walsh, &amp; Lyman, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">The current study sought to simultaneously build upon the three bodies of research outlined earlier: (a) the body of research examining EF and other self-regulatory constructs as risk factors for IPV; (b) the body of research examining alcohol dependence as a risk factor for IPV; and (c) the body of alcohol-administration research examining EF and other self-regulatory constructs as moderators of the association between acute consumption and aggressive behavior. In the current study, we examined the association of performance on laboratory impulsivity tasks, a broad battery of neuropsychological tests of EF, and self-reported impulsivity at the time of alcohol treatment entry with pretreatment year history of IPV. We hypothesized (a) that men with a pretreatment year history of IPV would evidence greater impulsivity and less executive control than men without a pretreatment year history of IPV. Among men with a pretreatment history of IPV, we further examined whether these measures of self-regulation processes were associated with the frequency of pretreatment year IPV. We hypothesized (b) that those with the greatest deficits in self-regulation would report the most frequent IPV in the year prior to treatment. Finally, we examined these self-regulation processes as moderators of the proximal association of alcohol consumption and IPV. We hypothesized (c) that IPV would be more likely to occur on drinking days for men who were low in self-regulation, but not for men who were high in self-regulation, and that no difference between these groups in IPV would be evident on nondrinking days. We had no hypotheses about which specific measures would be the most important predictors of IPV in this sample. Rather, a secondary goal of the current study was to identify which constructs and measures were most important.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p align="left">Study participants were men enrolled in residential substance abuse treatment, who met criteria for a primary alcohol dependence diagnosis, reported at least five occasions of drinking in the 60 days prior to treatment entry during screening, and were in a current or recent (ended within 1 month of study participation) heterosexual relationship of at least 1-year duration. Eligible participants were identified through a two-phase process. In the first phase, study staff conducted weekly group recruitment sessions at two residential substance abuse treatment facilities. At these sessions, the study was described to all men who had been admitted to the facility in the past week, and interested men were invited to complete the prescreening questionnaire to determine whether they were likely to meet study eligibility criteria. The prescreening criteria included: an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score of at least 8, which is indicative of a strong likelihood of hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption, a self-report of at least five occasions of drinking in the 60 days prior to treatment entry; a current or recent (ended within 1 month of study participation) relationship of at least 1-year duration; and an answer of &#8220;alcohol&#8221; or &#8220;both equal&#8221; to at least one of the five questions about drug and alcohol use. Men who met prescreening criteria (<italic>N</italic> = 139) were scheduled for a 3- to 4-hour interview and self-report questionnaire assessment session during which study eligibility was fully assessed.</p>
<p align="left">A total of 36 men did not meet study eligibility criteria during the interview and self-report questionnaire session for the following reasons: no current dependence diagnosis (<italic>n</italic> = 4), nonqualifying romantic relationship (<italic>n</italic> = 7), primary drug of abuse was not alcohol (<italic>n</italic> = 19), active psychotic symptoms (<italic>n</italic> = 1), multiple criteria not met (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and discontinued the session so eligibility could not be determined (<italic>n</italic> = 5). This resulted in a sample of 103 eligible participants. Seventy-seven percent of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 79) met criteria for at least one substance use disorder in addition to alcohol dependence. Approximately equal numbers of men were cohabiting (<italic>n</italic> = 54; 52%) and noncohabiting (<italic>n</italic> = 49; 48%) with their female partners. Six participants were excluded from analyses (5 left treatment before the second session and 1 had extensive missing data because of vision problems and an injury), resulting in a final sample of 97.

In the first step of the decision tree, the examiner noted whether the participant met criteria for current dependence on any substance. If not, the tree was ended. If only one substance was listed, that substance was considered the primary substance of abuse. If two or more substances were listed, the examiner noted which substance was used first, which first caused symptoms, which had caused the most symptoms, which had been used most in the past 90 days, which had been used most in the past year, and which had been an issue most often in treatment. The substance(s) with the most endorsements were the primary substance(s) of abuse.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p align="left">Study staff conducted weekly group recruitment and prescreening sessions at two residential substance abuse treatment facilities. Men who met prescreening criteria were scheduled for a 3- to 4-hour interview and self-report questionnaire assessment session during which study eligibility was fully assessed. These sessions were conducted in a private room at the treatment facility and were preceded by an institutional review board (IRB)-approved documented informed consent procedure. Participants were compensated $60 for this session. Men who met all study eligibility criteria during the interview and self-report questionnaire session were scheduled for a second session lasting 2&#8211;3 hr during which the neuropsychological tests and behavioral measures of delay discounting and behavioral inhibition were completed. All measures were administered by bachelor's level research assistants who were trained, tested for competence, and supervised by the first, second, and fourth authors who have considerable expertise and experience with interview and questionnaire assessments, behavioral measures of impulsivity and neuropsychological testing, respectively. Participants were required to maintain abstinence from alcohol and illicit drugs for 4 days prior to the laboratory session to reduce the risk that participant would be intoxicated or experiencing acute substance withdrawal during the session. Compliance with this requirement was assessed by self-report and confirmed by urine drug screen and breathalyzer testing. Because of the long half-life of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) metabolites, participants who tested positive for THC and reported marijuana use in the past 30 days, but not the past 4 days, were allowed to participate in the laboratory session. In addition, participants were asked to abstain from nicotine and caffeine for 1 hr prior to the laboratory session. Participants were compensated $60 for the second session.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p align="left">Raw DDT k-values, Trails B completion times, and CTS-2 physical aggression scores were non-normally distributed. Kendall's tau, which is less sensitive to non-normal distributions than Pearson's <italic>r</italic>, was utilized to examine bivariate correlations among neuropsychological, laboratory, and self-report measures of self-regulation, IPV, and control variables. Non-normally distributed variables were log-transformed prior to linear regression analyses. To test the hypothesis that self-regulation would predict whether a man had engaged in pretreatment year IPV, we conducted a sequential logistic regression analysis. To test the hypothesis that among men with a pretreatment history of IPV deficits in self-regulation would predict frequency of IPV, we conducted sequential linear regression analysis. In each of these analyses, age, head injury, SILS-V, and SILS-A were included as covariates.</p>
<p align="left">To test the hypothesis that self-regulation would moderate the association between daily alcohol use and IPV as measured by the TLFB, first a series of hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>) were tested. Six participants were excluded completely from these analyses, 4 of whom reported no contact with their partner and 2 of whom reported no alcohol or drug use during the 90-day TLFB (despite reports of 5 or more occasions of drinking during prescreening). In these models, the occurrence of male-to-female IPV on a given day was the dependent measure and alcohol use was modeled as a time-dependent covariate on level 1. Drug use on a given day was also modeled on level 1 to control for its effects. To allow for clearer interpretation of results, days on which a participant reported no contact with his female partner (<italic>n</italic> = 3012) were excluded from the analyses. Similarly, days on which drug and alcohol use were initiated after an episode of IPV (<italic>n</italic> = 1) were excluded from analyses. This resulted in a final sample of 5,420 days. Given that occurrence of male-to-female IPV had a value of 0 or 1, a Bernoulli sampling distribution was specified. A large difference between the robust and model <italic>SE</italic>s was observed in the intercepts only models, suggesting a model misspecification. Given that the number of participants was reasonably large relative to the number of level 2 predictors and the outcome variable is non-normally distributed, results from the population-average model with robust standard errors, which are relatively insensitive to model misspecifications are reported for all models (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-2" rid="c45">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>).

Three control variables (age, head injury, and Shipley verbal functioning) demonstrated significant or trend level associations with physical IPV.

<title>Self-Regulation as a Moderator of the Daily Association Between IPV and Drinking</title>
<p align="left">In our final set of analyses, we examined the self-regulation processes as moderators of the proximal association of substance use and IPV in multilevel models. A total of 5,420 days were modeled on level 1, including: 82 IPV days, 4,293 drinking days, and 2,782 drug use days. In the intercepts-only model, controlling for daily drug use, the likelihood of IPV was higher on days of alcohol use, &#946; = 0.52 (robust <italic>SE</italic> = 0.24), <italic>t</italic>(5415) = 2.14, <italic>p</italic> = .03; OR = 1.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05&#8211;2.69). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc4-1" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>, in the model building analyses, all measures of self-regulation and control variables with the exception of age, the COWA, SDM, DDT, and GoStop met criteria for inclusion in the multivariate model. The TMT, SNST, and IVE met criteria for inclusion in the multivariate model but were not significant predictors of the daily association of IPV and alcohol consumption. Thus, a total of 6 measures emerged as significant predictors of the daily association between alcohol consumption and IPV in univariate models: head injury score, SILS-V, SILS-A, RFFT, CAT-CV, and TOL<sup location="post">DX</sup>. Examination of model graphs revealed that effects for SILS-V, SILS-A, CAT-CV, and RFFT were contrary to predictions: Better performance appeared to be associated with <italic>lower</italic> likelihood of IPV on <italic>nondrinking</italic> days. No differences between high versus low performers on drinking days, or between low performers on drinking versus nondrinking days were apparent.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p align="left">In the current study, we examined the association of performance on laboratory delay discounting and behavioral inhibition tasks, neuropsychological tests of EF, and self-reported impulsivity at the time of alcohol treatment entry with reports of pretreatment IPV. First we examined whether greater impulsivity and less executive control predicted the occurrence and frequency of IPV in the pretreatment year. Then we examined whether these constructs moderated the proximal association of alcohol consumption and IPV, controlling for drug use.</p>
<p align="left">Hypotheses in the current study received very modest support. Contrary to our hypotheses that multiple measures of behavioral self-regulation would be significant predictors of the occurrence and frequency of IPV perpetration in the year prior to assessment, the self-report measure of impulsivity (IVE) was the only measure of self-regulation that significantly predicted the occurrence of IPV in a logistic regression model. Moreover, none of the measures were significant predictors of the frequency of IPV in the linear regression models, and the IVE was the only measure that approached significance in these models. Evaluation of the correlation matrix revealed that the IVE was also the only measure associated with past year reports of psychological aggression. These findings may reflect the fact that with the exception of the <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-2" rid="c52">Schafer and Fals-Stewart (1997)</xref> study, many of the studies in which the most pervasive differences between groups were found compared men who were arrested or seeking treatment for domestic violence with controls recruited through other means. Given evidence that IPV perpetration is a heterogeneous phenomenon (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Holtzworth-Munroe &amp; Stuart, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Johnson, 2008</xref>), it may be that EF is most useful for distinguishing men with more severe or pervasive patterns of IPV from controls. This interpretation is generally consistent with findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-3" rid="c66">Walling et al. (2011)</xref> who found that EF was better at differentiating men with a history of severe IPV from controls than men with low-level antisocial or family only types of IPV. It may also be that measures of EF are less predictive of IPV in an alcohol-dependent sample, because deficits in EF are much more common in such samples than in the general population (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-4" rid="c6">Bates et al., 2002</xref>). This interpretation is consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-2" rid="c20">Easton et al. (2008)</xref> that neuropsychological test performance more reliably differentiated alcohol-dependent men with and without IPV from nonalcohol-dependent controls than from one another. Although importantly, examination of the means and <italic>SD</italic>s in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-2" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, suggests there was reasonable variance in the predictors in this alcohol-dependent sample.</p>
<p align="left">It is interesting that despite the lack of association between the occurrence of IPV and neuropsychological and behavioral measures of self-regulation, head injury was a significant predictor of the occurrence of past year IPV. This is consistent with prior research demonstrating an association between head injury and IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-3" rid="c13">Cohen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">Rosenbaum &amp; Hoge, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-4" rid="c66">Walling et al., 2011</xref>) and may suggest that a simple model in which the relationship between head injury and IPV is mediated by neuropsychological deficits does not capture the complexity of the relationship between head injury and IPV. It is also possible that neuropsychological deficits other than EF mediate this relationship.</p>
<p align="left">General intellectual functioning, as indexed by the SILS-A and SILS-V, figural fluency (RFFT), and the ability to abstract and shift cognitive sets (CAT-CV) moderated the association between daily drinking (controlling for daily drug use) and IPV perpetration in the 90 days prior to assessment in univariate, multilevel models. However, contrary to our prediction that poor performance would predict IPV on drinking days, results suggested that better performance actually predicted a <italic>lower</italic> likelihood of IPV on <italic>nondrinking</italic> days. Directly contrary to hypotheses, better performance on the TOL<sup location="post">DX</sup> was associated with greater IPV on drinking days. In the final multivariate model, self-reported (IVE) and performance on the TOL<sup location="post">DX</sup> were the only significant predictors of the daily association between drinking and IPV perpetration controlling for daily drug use. However, as in the univariate models, the findings for the TOL<sup location="post">DX</sup> were directly contrary to hypotheses. The findings for the TOL<sup location="post">DX</sup> were not expected and must thus be interpreted with extreme caution. If this finding is replicated in future research, one potentially useful explanatory framework is the proactive versus reactive aggression conceptualization of IPV (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Chase, O'Leary, &amp; Heyman, 2001</xref>). Within this framework, proactive aggression is planned and strategic aggression that is utilized to achieve relationship goals, whereas reactive aggression is inconsistent with overall relationship goals and occurs in reaction to conflict. Given the disinhibiting effects of alcohol, it is possible that IPV occurring on nondrinking days in dependent drinkers is more likely to be proactive than reactive. Moreover, given that successful performance on the TOL<sup location="post">DX</sup> relies, in part on planning and strategy, it is possible that partner-violent men who perform well on this task may be more likely to use proactive aggression. However, future research is needed to test this speculation.</p>
<p align="left">The current study is important in that it sought to replicate and extend findings from laboratory aggression research documenting EF and other self-regulation constructs as a moderator of alcohol related aggression in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-2" rid="c26">Giancola, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-2" rid="c29">Giancola et al., 2012</xref>). With its reliance on a timeline followback method to assess naturally occurring alcohol consumption and IPV perpetration in treatment-seeking men diagnosed with alcohol dependence, the current study provides a complement to prior research using alcohol self-administration and laboratory aggression tasks with social drinkers. Overall, the findings of the current study suggest the findings from prior alcohol self-administration studies may not be fully applicable to treatment-seeking dependent drinkers, many of whom also engage in illicit drug use, and/or the types of IPV most common among men in alcohol treatment settings.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, increased likelihood of men engaging in IPV following alcohol consumption found in the current study with a clinical population is consistent with prior research using non-alcohol-treatment seeking samples. For example, Moore and colleagues reported increased odds of engaging in IPV following alcohol consumption in a convenience sample of 184 college students (men = 38; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr75-1" rid="c75">Moore, Elkins, McNully, Kivisto, &amp; Handsel, 2011</xref>). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr78-1" rid="c78">Rothman and colleagues (2012)</xref> found in a sample of emerging adults (age range 17&#8211;21) reporting to an urban emergency department (<italic>N</italic> = 397, 44% male), increased odds of perpetrating dating abuse on drinking days compared with nondrinking days. These data underscore the important role of alcohol consumption in some perpetrators of IPV.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p align="left">There are important limitations to the current study. The first is that we did not capture data on the number of prospective participants who were invited to participate in the prescreening and refused or who were prescreened and found ineligible. Thus, it is impossible to determine how representative the sample obtained was of the recruitment facility. The second is that because of exploratory nature and small sample size of the current study, the focus was limited to heterosexual men. Although both men and women in substance abuse treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-2" rid="c62">Stuart et al., 2009</xref>) and a variety of other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Archer, 2000</xref>) report approximately equal rates of IPV perpetration, the majority of IPV research, including the current study, focuses on male perpetrators because of research demonstrating more significant physical and psychological consequences of male-perpetrated IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Archer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Coker et al., 2002</xref>). However, there is evidence that IPV perpetration by women may also have important public health implications, including serious psychological harms to male victims and thus should be studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-2" rid="c3">Archer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-2" rid="c14">Coker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Hines &amp; Malley-Morrison, 2001</xref>). There is also clear evidence for the public health significance of IPV in same-sex relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">Island &amp; Letellier, 1991</xref>) and additional research on the role of alcohol in IPV in these relationships is needed. A third limitation is the measurement strategy for IPV. As noted previously, there is compelling evidence that IPV is a heterogeneous phenomenon (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-2" rid="c38">Johnson, 2008</xref>), and the CTS2 and TLFB-SV do not yield sufficient information to categorize meaningful patterns of IPV. A related limitation is the reliance on men's self-reports of IPV perpetration. There is evidence that men may underreport IPV relative to their female partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-3" rid="c3">Archer, 1999</xref>), and thus reports of IPV in the current study may be underestimates. However, requiring female partner participation for studies of men in substance abuse treatment may result in sample bias, as not all female partners may be successfully recruited to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1" rid="c53">Schumacher et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">It is also important to note the challenges of conceptualizing and measuring self-regulation in substance abusing populations. First, although often described or alluded to as a one-dimensional construct, there is evidence that processes underlying impulsive, dysregulated behaviors are multidimensional (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-1" rid="c68">White et al., 1994</xref>). The current study sought to address this challenge with a multimethod battery that included several measures of putative self-regulatory processes. However, the findings of current study, as with prior research on self-regulation and IPV, do not lend themselves to firm conclusions about which aspects of self-regulation are most relevant to understanding the relationship between alcohol and IPV. The current study suggests that EF, delay discounting, and behavioral inhibition may not be that useful for understanding IPV among treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent men. Another challenge in conceptualizing and measuring self-regulation in an alcohol treatment sample is that self-regulatory processes appear quite sensitive to the effects of substances. Chronic substance abuse may lead to persistent deficits that gradually improve with prolonged abstinence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-2" rid="c5">Bates et al., 2004</xref>). As such, the self-regulatory processes under consideration in the current study represent a &#8220;moving target.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">A final challenge in studying treatment-seeking men with alcohol dependence is that many also use substances other than alcohol. Although men in the current study identified alcohol as a primary drug of abuse, the majority reported use of, abuse of, or dependence on other drugs. Daily drug use was included as a control variable in the HGLM analyses to provide a clearer indication of whether the variables of interest moderated the association between daily drinking and IPV. In future research, the unique effects of daily drug use, which has also been associated with IPV and deficits in self-regulation, must be examined. Future research must also examine whether the findings of this study are upheld in other populations including nondependent and non-treatment-seeking drinkers as well as men who are arrested or seeking treatment for IPV.</p>
