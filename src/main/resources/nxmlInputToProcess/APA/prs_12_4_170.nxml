<p align="left">This study adopts conservation of resources theory to investigate the relationship between psychological
          capital (PsyCap) and outcomes of work well-being and work-life balance among Chinese employees. A 2-wave
          survey was conducted among 287 health care workers in Chinese societies. Adapted from Western scales, a

          demonstrated that PsyCap at Time 1 had a significant positive relationship with participants&#8217; work
          well-being (higher levels of job satisfaction and physical/psychological well-being) and more work-life
          balance at Time 2 (conducted 5 months later). Implications for theory and practice are discussed.</p>

<sec id="s1">
      
<p align="left">There has been emerging research on psychological capital
        (PsyCap) in positive organizational behavior (POB) in recent years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">Luthans, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Luthans, Youssef, &amp;
          Avolio, 2007</xref>). PsyCap is positive state-like psychological capacities and
        &#8220;characterized by (1) having confidence (self-efficacy) to take on and put in the necessary effort to
        succeed at challenging tasks; (2) making a positive attribution (optimism) about succeeding now and in the
        future; (3) persevering towards goals, and when necessary, redirecting paths to goals (hope) in order to
        succeed; and (4) when beset by problems and adversity, sustaining and bouncing back and even beyond (resiliency)
        to attain success (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-2" rid="c36">Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007, p.
          3</xref>).&#8221; PsyCap has been found to be beneficial in human resource management such as
        enhancing organizational members&#8217; sales, job performance, organizational citizenship behavior, job
        satisfaction, organizational commitment, psychological well-being, and combating employee stress (e.g.,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">Avey, Luthans, Smith, &amp; Palmer, 2010</xref>;
          <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Avey, Luthans, &amp; Youssef, 2009</xref>). According to
        Luthans and his coworkers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Luthans &amp; Youssef,
          2007</xref>), researchers should focus on PsyCap as a means to enable employees to face
        challenges, adversity, and stress in the workplace.</p>
      
<p align="left">Given the increasing number of dual-earner couples and
        single-parent workers as well as greater elder care responsibilities, work-family interface has been a more
        important but also more complex issue in contemporary modern societies. However, there has been little study
        investigating the relationship of PsyCap with work-family interface. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-1" rid="c57">World Health Organization (1948)</xref>, health is a state of complete
        physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity. According to
        Conservation of Resources (COR) theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Hobfoll,
          1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">2002</xref>), it is believed
        that PsyCap is a personal characteristic resource which can provide valuable capacity to handle workplace
        demands and stress and its impact can be extended to nonwork social domain such as work-life balance. In the
        current study, adopting COR theory, it is proposed that work-life balance is an additional work-related outcome
        of PsyCap.</p>
      
<p align="left">The aims of the present study are threefold: (a) to resolve some
        conceptual issues of PsyCap and to demonstrate its validity evidence, (b) to replicate previous studies to
        examine the relationship between PsyCap and work well-being, and (c) to conduct a novel investigation on the
        relationship between PsyCap and work-life balance. Thus the present study contributes to the literature by
        investigating whether PsyCap is also a valuable personal asset among Chinese employees. It has been challenged
        that the field of organizational psychology has limited cross-cultural generalizability (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Ryan, Leong, &amp; Oswald, 2012</xref>). As about one-fifth of the
        world&#8217;s population is Chinese, evidence of a systematic development and validation of PsyCap measures in
        Chinese settings and investigating its relationships to work outcomes likely contributes to theory and research
        in POB. To date, this is the first Chinese study which has examined work-family interface, specifically
        work-life balance, as a consequence of PsyCap. The present study also has methodological contribution to the
        field by adopting a 2-wave design to provide construct and convergent validity evidence of a measure of PsyCap.
        Further, a cross-lagged panel analysis was conducted on the 2-wave matched data as it is an appropriate method
        to probe the influence of PsyCap as employees&#8217; beneficial resources for enhancing their work well-being
        and work-life balance. The results of the study and the validated measure of PsyCap have practical implications
        for personnel practices and can resolve some conceptual issues of PsyCap.</p>

<title>The Present Study</title>
      
<p align="left">Employees in the health care sector in Hong Kong and the PRC
        were targeted because these professionals specifically nurses constitute a high stress group (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">McVicar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Siu,
          2002</xref>). This is especially true after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in
        2003. Women may be at a greater risk of facing work-life imbalance (e.g., working shift), as females constitute
        a high percentage of the health care sector workforce in Western and Chinese societies, and they are more prone
        to work-family interface issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Noor, 2003</xref>). Yet
        more unfortunately, health workers are particularly at risk for workplace violence. For instance, there were
        2,757 incidents of workplace violence reported by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority between 2000 and 2004. It is
        suggested that personal resources can protect health care workers particularly nurses from stress and burnout
        and thus maintain their work engagement in high work demand contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">Garrosa, Moreno-Jim&#233;nez, Rodr&#237;guez-Mu&#241;oz, &amp; Rodr&#237;guez-Carvajal,
          2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Lu, Siu, Chen, &amp; Wang,
          2011</xref>). As noted earlier on, our research will have practical implications for personnel
        practices because our findings can provide support for practitioners to undertake interventions with the purpose
        of developing human psychological resources (i.e., PsyCap).</p>

<title>PsyCap as a Higher-Order Core Construct</title>
        
<p align="left">Conceptually, it has been summarized and argued that PsyCap is
          a higher-order construct consisting of the shared variance of hope, efficacy, optimism, and resilience
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-2" rid="c2">Avey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-3" rid="c36">Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007</xref>); and this higher-order core factor
          has been empirically demonstrated and it may be a better predictor of performance than the four individual
          facets (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Luthans, Avolio, Avey, &amp; Norman.,
            2007</xref>). However, one may argue that the empirical study by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-2" rid="c33">Luthans, Avolio, et al. (2007)</xref> only adopted a cross-sectional design and no
          information was provided whether there was any significant difference between a higher-order model and a
          four-factor without a higher-order model. The current study attempted to adopt a 2-wave design to provide
          evidence of a higher-order model of PsyCap.</p>

<title>Measure of PsyCap</title>
        
<p align="left">In terms of measure, evidence of the relationship between
          PsyCap (measured with a 24-item and a short version 12-item instrument) and work outcomes (job performance,
          work attitudes) has been demonstrated among diverse samples cross-culturally including US, Australia, China,
          India, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, and some European countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Luthans, Avolio, Walumbwa, &amp; Li, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Luthans, Avey, Clapp-Smith, &amp; Li, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-2" rid="c35">Luthans &amp; Youssef, 2007</xref>). Yet those studies only adopted cross-sectional designs
          and the reliability of optimism was rather low.</p>
        
<p align="left">Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Little,
            Gooty, and Nelson (2007)</xref> explored the validation evidence of the four PsyCap measures
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-2" rid="c29">Luthans, 2002</xref>) across two longitudinal
          studies. They concluded that there was a lack of predictive validity of the PsyCap measures over state
          positive affect in relation to the outcome variables such as general satisfaction, motivation, and turnover
          intention. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-2" rid="c25">Little et al. (2007)</xref> also raised
          serious concern when adopting more rigorous psychometric evaluation using structural equation modeling: the
          construct and discriminant validity were not well supported, specifically there was a lack of discriminant
          validity between hope and optimism. We therefore adopted a more vigorous design to provide validity evidence
          of a measure of PsyCap.</p>

<title>State-Like vs. Trait-Like</title>
        
<p align="left">PsyCap is considered as state-like capacities which are
          relatively more malleable and thus are open to change and development than trait-like personality
          characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-3" rid="c29">Luthans, 2002</xref>;
            <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-3" rid="c35">Luthans &amp; Youssef, 2007</xref>). However, some
          researchers challenge the absolute state-like nature of PsyCap because all four constructs that make it up
          have been conceptualized as both state-like and trait-like. Some recent studies have demonstrated that PsyCap
          can be developed in short training intervention (e.g., 3 hr) with employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Luthans, Avey, Avolio, Noramn, &amp; Combs, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-3" rid="c2">Avey et al. (2010)</xref> reported that employees&#8217; PsyCap was
          related to two measures of well-being over an interval of three weeks. To resolve this paradox,
            <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Luthans and Avolio (2009)</xref> concluded that PsyCap
          is positioned as mid-range &#8220;state-like,&#8221; changeable but also relatively stable over time, and
          they called for more research on the stability of PsyCap over time.</p>

<title>How Is PsyCap Different From Core Self-Evaluation?</title>
        
<p align="left">According to Judge and coauthors, there are individual
          differences in how people like or dislike themselves and how they see themselves as capable and effective.
          This attribute of personality is called <italic>core self-evaluation</italic>, which comprises four traits:
          self-esteem, generalised self-efficacy, locus of control, and lack of neuroticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Judge, Erez, Bono, &amp; Thoresen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Judge, Locke, Durham, &amp; Kluger, 1998</xref>). It has been found that
          employees with positive core self-evaluations have higher levels of job satisfaction, job performance, and
          life satisfaction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Judge &amp; Bono, 2001</xref>;
            <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-2" rid="c20">Judge et al., 1998</xref>). Even though PsyCap and
          Core self-evaluation have an overlap component of self-efficacy and both predict work-related outcomes of job
          satisfaction and job performance, core self-evaluation is a trait-like construct and PsyCap is a mid-range
          &#8220;state-like&#8221; one.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses</title>
      
<p align="left">The basic tenet of <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-2" rid="c14">Hobfoll&#8217;s (1989)</xref> COR theory is that people strive to retain, protect, and build
        resources and that what is threatening to them is the potential or actual loss of these valued resources
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-3" rid="c14">Hobfoll, 1989, p. 513</xref>). According to
          <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-4" rid="c14">Hobfoll (1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-2" rid="c15">2002</xref>), resources include objects, conditions, personal characteristics, and
        energies. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-3" rid="c15">Hobfoll&#8217;s (2002)</xref> review
        on different resource theories, the four distinct components which manifest the core construct of PsyCap
        identified as resources of personal characteristics, which could exert their impacts on stress resistance, and
        thus enhance the capability of individuals in tackling problems and fit the demands in stressful circumstances.
        In addition, Hobfoll also notes that resources are linked to each other and people with a solid reservoir of
        resources are likely to have further enrichment of their resources. Therefore, individuals who have already
        possessed reserves of PsyCap are capable of substituting resources used in dealing with demands in stressful
        situations, and were thus less likely to suffer from stress symptoms. Hence, PsyCap can be conceptualized as a
        personal psychological resource and would enable employees to face challenges, stress, incidents, or violence
        according to COR theory.</p>

<title>PsyCap and Work Well-Being</title>
      
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-1" rid="c56">Warr
          (1987)</xref> categorized concepts such as job satisfaction, job-related tension, and job-related
        depression as work well-being. Many studies of Chinese societies have taken job satisfaction, physical and
        psychological well-being as the three facets of work well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Liu,
          Siu, &amp; Shi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">Siu, Lu &amp; Spector,
          2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1" rid="c50">Siu, Spector, &amp; Cooper,
          2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">Siu, Spector, Cooper, &amp; Lu,
          2005</xref>). COR theory has been applied to attribute how PsyCap relates to employee well-being,
        as individuals cognitively appraise stressful situations and adapt positively by maintaining resources
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-4" rid="c2">Avey et al., 2010</xref>). According to COR theory,
        one&#8217;s ability to acquire and maintain resources is both a means and an end &#8211; a means for achieving
        success and an end that include adaptation, coping, and well-being, depending on his/her cognitive appraisal
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>). People with high
        PsyCap would maintain, recover, or improve in mental or physical health facing or following stress (e.g.,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Bonanno, 2004</xref>). They would report less stress
        symptoms. Further, resources can aggregate to create resource caravans (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-4" rid="c15">Hobfoll, 2002</xref>). As PsyCap is conceptualized as personal resources, these positive
        psychological capacities of self-efficacy, resiliency, optimism, and hope are related, can aggregate, and should
        exert influence on one&#8217;s work well-being. Based on data from a large sample of working adults in the
        United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Avey, Luthans, and Jensen (2009)</xref>
        suggested that PsyCap may be a key to better understanding the variation in perceived symptoms of stress.
        Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-5" rid="c2">Avey et al. (2010)</xref>, based on COR theory,
        analyzed the relationship between a cross-section of employees&#8217; level of PsyCap and two measures of
        psychological well-being (Indexes of Psychological Well-being and General Health Questionnaire) over time. Their
        results showed that PsyCap explained additional variance in these two well-being measures over time. It is
        therefore hypothesized that,
          
<statement content-type="hypothesis">
<p align="left"><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: PsyCap will be positively

<title>PsyCap and Work-Life Balance</title>
      
<p align="left">Work-life balance is used to include a broad range of nonwork
        demands and activities in which employees could experience. Such employee activities may include personal
        relationships and health, family responsibilities, volunteer work, sporting performances, study, religion, and
        travel (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Jones, Burke, &amp; Westman, 2006</xref>;
          <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Kamenou, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Kalliath and Brough (2008)</xref> have recently provided a theoretical definition of
        work-life balance which emphasized the importance of subjective individual perceptions of balance (as opposed to
        objective measures of time and/or satisfaction expended in each domain) and the recognition that these
        perceptions may change over time in response to changing life priorities. In line with positive psychology, when
        an individual with high PsyCap faces the demands that arise from the two domains of work and family/nonwork,
        he/she will cognitively appraise the task of combining work and family/nonwork life domains roles as a challenge
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-2" rid="c23">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-1" rid="c55">van Steenbergen, Ellemers, Haslam, &amp; Urlings, 2008</xref>). The
        individual will then think positively about the demanding situation by positive reframing. This individual will
        in turn feel capable of drawing valuable work and family resources and having mastery of both work and nonwork
        demands, and thus perceives more work-life balance.</p>
      
<p align="left">Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-5" rid="c15">Hobfoll
          (2002)</xref> theorized that &#8220;people strive to obtain, retain, protect, and foster
        resources in biological, cognitive, and social domains&#8221; (p. 317). Yet research adopting COR theory to
        social domain such as work-family interface is relatively rarer. It is believed that work-life balance is
        another work-related outcome of the resource of PsyCap. As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Coutu (2002)</xref>, it is expected that workers with high PsyCap will accept reality and hold
        strongly onto meaningful and stable values and beliefs. They would therefore be able to seek a more balanced
        life and feel more satisfied with different domains of life. The resource of PsyCap (e.g., having
        self-confidence to master different domains of life, have hope to achieve goal, and optimistic about future) can
        help health care employees to preserve their perception of balance between work and life, and they are less
        vulnerable to future resource loss due to work-family conflict/demand. Hence, it is hypothesized that,

          choose the right time interval or the length of causal lag remains a question in occupational health
          psychology. In the past, the time lag adopted by cross-lagged studies in work-family interface ranged from 6
          weeks to 6 years, with most studies taking a time lag of 1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Demerouti, Bakker, &amp; Bulters, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Leiter

          with a 5-month time lag to test the casual effect of a mid-range &#8220;state-like&#8221; PsyCap on work
          well-being and work-life balance. The time 1 (T1) data was collected from health care workers in Hong Kong and
          three cities in the PRC. Each participant in Hong Kong was invited to fill in a questionnaire shortly before a
          seminar on work-life balance. For the sample recruited in the PRC, the completed questionnaires were returned
          in sealed envelopes within a week. Before administering the survey, the researcher explained the purpose of
          the project and sought their consent to participate. Participants were asked to write a self-identifiable code
          which was needed to match the T2 responses.</p>
        
<p align="left">Of all the respondents from T1 survey (<italic>N</italic> =

          were single or never married; and their job tenure varied from less than a year to 40 years
            (<italic>M</italic> = 11, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.1). Of the 773 participants who took part in T1, 441 (57%)
          also participated in T2 survey 5 month after T1. After matching T2 survey with T1, we got 287 matched
          questionnaires. For T2 survey (<italic>N</italic> = 287), 88 (31%) were from Hong Kong, 199 (69%) were from
          Beijing, one of the three sampled cities. As the respondents from Hong Kong were sampled by attending a
          seminar on work-life balance, and one of the main variables was work-life balance, a dropout analysis was
          performed to check if there was a form of self-selection. There was no significant difference between the
          dropped out (<italic>N</italic> = 486) and retained (<italic>N</italic> = 287) sample in terms of all the main

          between Hong Kong respondents (<italic>N</italic> = 88) and PRC respondents (<italic>N</italic> = 199) in
          terms of all the main variables at both time points. It turned out Hong Kong respondents perceived a
          significant higher level of work-life balance than PRC respondents at both time points. There was no
          significant difference in other variables between these two groups. As Hong Kong and PR China used to be

<title>Analysis</title>
      
<p align="left">First of all, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to
        test the higher-order model of PsyCap manifested by four latent factors (resiliency, optimism, hope, and
        self-efficacy) in the whole T1 sample (<italic>N</italic> = 773) using the LISREL 8.70 program. We also examined
        the temporal stability of the higher-order model of PsyCap in the matched sample (<italic>N</italic> = 287).</p>
      
<p align="left">In the second step, prior to the cross-lagged analyses, a series
        of measurement models was examined to support the discriminant validity of PsyCap, work well-being, and
        work-life balance. Specifically, the hypothesized <italic>eight-factor</italic> model (PsyCap, job satisfaction,
        physical/psychological well-being, and work-life balance, at both T1 and T2, respectively) was compared with a
          <italic>four-factor</italic> model, which made a distinction between PsyCap, job satisfaction,
        physical/psychological well-being, and work-life balance (irrespective of time of measure). In addition, a
          <italic>two-factor</italic> model reflecting the time of measurement (T1 measures loading on one factor and T2
        measures loading on the other), and a one-factor model (in which all indicators were constrained to load on a
        single factor) were specified. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Cole and Maxwell
          (2003)</xref>, in testing the measurement models we allowed the error terms of corresponding
        indicator variables to be correlated and constrained the factor loadings (the paths between indicator variables
        and latent factors) to be equal across waves for the measure equivalence.</p>
      
<p align="left">In the third step, the predictive relationship between PsyCap
        and work well-being and social well-being was tested by nested structural equation models (SEM). To do this, a

<title>Discussion</title>
      
<p align="left">This study aimed to investigate the relationship between
        psychological capital (PsyCap) and outcomes of work well-being and work-life balance among Chinese employees. In
        this 2-wave survey among health care workers in Hong Kong and the PRC, the higher-order model of psychological
        capital was confirmed comprising four-factors: self-efficacy, optimism, hope, and resiliency. Hence the findings
        obtained corroborate the empirical study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-3" rid="c33">Luthans, Avolio,
          et al. (2007)</xref>. The beneficial influence of PsyCap on work well-being and work-life balance
        was also demonstrated. The results showed that, even after controlling for the effects of the respective outcome
        variables measured at T1, PsyCap still had significant positive correlation with participants&#8217; work
        well-being by enhancing their job satisfaction and their physical/psychological well-being. These results
        corroborate previous studies in Western societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-6" rid="c2">Avey et al.,
          2010</xref>). Further, PsyCap also significantly enhanced participants&#8217; work-life balance
        in T2. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-6" rid="c14">Hobfoll&#8217;s (1989)</xref> COR
        theory, PsyCap, which is a personal resource and a mid-range state-like personal characteristic, during a period
        of 5 months, could serve as a resource to exert an impact on enhancing the perception of work-life balance in
        addition to work well-being. As argued earlier, the work-related social domain of work-family interface has been
        a neglected area in PsyCap research. This construct is now found to be extended to employees&#8217; social
        domain including positive cognitive appraisal of work-family/life interaction processes. Hence, the current
        study has bridged the gap of knowledge between PsyCap and work-family/life and occupational health psychology
        research.</p>
      
<p align="left">Our findings have also provided evidence to resolve some of the
        conceptual issues of PsyCap as mentioned earlier and therefore contribute to academic knowledge. Ample evidence
        is provided to show the stability of PsyCap over a period of 5 months. Hence, PsyCap is relatively stable yet
        not qualified to be considered having trait properties according to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-1" rid="c58">Wright (2007)</xref> and thus a mid-range &#8216;state-like&#8217; construct as concluded by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-2" rid="c32">Luthans and Avolio (2009)</xref>. Further, as to date,
        this study is the first study which has demonstrated that PsyCap is a higher-order construct and is
        statistically significantly different from a four-factor model without a higher-order model.</p>

<title>Practical Implications</title>
        
<p align="left">In terms of practical implications for human resource
          management, in a global economy, most organizations in Hong Kong and PRC, in particular Beijing, face
          challenges such as an uncertain economy, globalization of markets, and ever-changing technology. To meet these
          challenges/crises, it is important for an organization to strive for health and well-being through investment
          in human resources so as to seek competitive advantage. Therefore, as PsyCap is an antecedent of work
          well-being, investment in developing positive capacities of PsyCap is an attractive course of action for human
          resource managers in Greater China. More workshops should be organized by human resource management group to
          enhance employees&#8217; each of the four dimensions of PsyCap. The training of <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-2" rid="c30">Luthans et al. (2006)</xref> is an example of such a workshop.
          Furthermore, because PsyCap could exert an impact on work-life balance, practices and intervention work
          involving work-life interactions should incorporate each of the four dimensions of PsyCap as personal
          resources in both Chinese and Western societies. The other practical implication is that, this developed
          instrument can be used by senior executives, human resource managers, or practitioners for assessing the
          impact of intervention training on nourishing PsyCap. Specifically, managers and practitioners in
          cross-cultural management can be equipped with this developed concept and measure of PsyCap for enhancing
          employees&#8217; well-being and lead to better practices.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
      
<p align="left">The limitations include the large attrition rate in T2. The
        dropout analyses revealed that there might be a self-selection bias because some participants were
        self-motivated to attend the seminars. However, when comparing the dropped out sample with the retained sample,
        their demographic characteristics were quite similar. In addition, perhaps more work is needed to demonstrate
        how PsyCap is distinguished from similar construct say the core construct of Core Self-evaluations in Chinese
        settings. Lack of an objective measure is another limitation of the study. Another limitation of the study is
        the unbalanced gender composition in the sample. There were more females than males in this sample. Future
        research should include more male participants and extend to other occupational groups in order to provide
        evidence of convergent validity and generalizability.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
      
<p align="left">The PsyCap construct as a personal characteristic resource, to a
        certain extent, can be generalized to Chinese health care employees. This study contributes to the literature by
        providing evidence of a mid-range state-like higher-order PsyCap model and a valid 22-item measure of PsyCap in
        Chinese contexts, and empirically testing the relationship between PsyCap and work well-being, and testing
        work-life balance as another outcome of PsyCap.</p>
