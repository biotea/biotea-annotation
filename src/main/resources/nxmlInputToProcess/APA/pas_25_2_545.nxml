<p align="left">Approximately 30%&#8211;40% of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) meet criteria for a comorbid anxiety disorder in clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1" rid="c41">Tannock, 2009</xref>), but little is known about treatment response for this subgroup. The current study evaluated processes of change in a psychosocial treatment designed for children with ADHD and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Jarrett &amp; Ollendick, 2012</xref>). Processes included the slope of symptom change during treatment, the temporal relations between ADHD and anxiety symptoms during treatment, and changes in neurocognitive functioning, parent&#8211;child relationships, and family functioning. Treatment involved a combination of parent management training for ADHD and family based cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety. Sessions lasted approximately 90 min, and the treatment consisted of 10 weekly sessions. Eight children ages 8&#8211;12 with ADHD, combined type (ADHD-C), and at least 1 of 3 anxiety disorders (separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia) were selected for the study. The study utilized a single-case design with weekly measures of ADHD and anxiety symptoms along with pretreatment, midtreatment, and 1-week posttreatment assessments. Slopes of symptom change and temporal relationships among symptom domains were examined using simulation modeling analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Borckardt et al., 2008</xref>), while other analyses involved standard comparisons across time points. Results generally supported declining slopes for ADHD and anxiety and greater concurrent change between anxiety and hyperactivity/impulsivity than anxiety and inattention. Few changes were found for neurocognitive functioning, but some changes were found for parent&#8211;child relationships and family functioning. Future studies are needed to better understand the treatment of ADHD and comorbid anxiety.</p>

<sec id="s1">
<p align="left">A small body of research has been devoted to studying the characteristics of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and comorbid anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Jarrett &amp; Ollendick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-2" rid="c41">Tannock, 2009</xref>), but few studies have examined psychosocial treatment response. The Multimodal Treatment of ADHD Study (MTA Study; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">MTA Cooperative Group, 1999</xref>) was one of the first studies to examine large-scale, ADHD treatment effects in relation to comorbidity. For comorbid anxiety, the study found a differential response to behavioral treatment when parent-reported child anxiety was present. More specifically, children with ADHD and comorbid anxiety responded more positively to behavioral treatment on parent-reported hyperactivity/impulsivity and internalizing problems than did children without parent-reported anxiety. In interpreting this finding, MTA Study authors noted that the behavioral treatment of core symptoms of ADHD might possibly serve to reduce internalizing problems such as anxiety. The authors further noted that behavioral interventions designed to treat anxiety (e.g., cognitive-behavioral interventions) might have resulted in even greater benefits, given that interventions in the MTA Study targeted ADHD-related behaviors but not anxiety. Although the MTA Study offered the unique ability to examine effects of comorbidity on treatment outcome, it was primarily designed to address aggregate outcomes. In turn, little is known about individual-level response and processes of change over treatment for children with ADHD and anxiety.</p>
<p align="left">While little is known about processes of change, substantive reasons for the comorbidity of ADHD and anxiety have been explored and have included areas such as genetic influences, temperament, neurobiological and neuropsychological functioning, family influences, and the temporal relations between symptom domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-2" rid="c19">Jarrett &amp; Ollendick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-3" rid="c41">Tannock, 2009</xref>). Such substantive reasons for comorbidity remain largely unexplored within the context of treatment research. In addition to these variables, an important variable to consider in any treatment study is the rate of change and <italic>when</italic> changes occur during the course of treatment. Such information may be valuable in better understanding treatment components that may be particularly important for treatment. In addition to the rate of symptom change, the temporal relationships between ADHD and anxiety symptoms, as noted above, may be an important variable to consider. For example, ADHD symptom change may precede anxiety symptom change or anxiety symptom change may precede ADHD symptom change. Alternatively, symptoms may change concurrently. For example, if ADHD and anxiety symptoms are affected by a shared influence (e.g., dysfunctional parent&#8211;child relationships), a change in that influence may result in concurrent symptom change.</p>
<p align="left">In relation to common influences, an important factor to consider is parent&#8211;child relationships and family functioning. Although a large literature has documented parent&#8211;child relationship difficulties with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Johnston &amp; Mash, 2001</xref>), more specialized research has noted even greater parent&#8211;child relationship and family difficulties for children with ADHD and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-3" rid="c19">Jarrett &amp; Ollendick, 2008</xref>; Kepley &amp; Ostrander, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Pfiffner &amp; McBurnett, 2006</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Kepley and Ostrander (2007)</xref> found that children with ADHD and anxiety exhibited similar levels of family conflict as children with ADHD only, but families of children with ADHD and anxiety exhibited greater problems with lacking independence and exhibiting an overly controlling environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-2" rid="c33">Pfiffner and McBurnett (2006)</xref> found that parents of children with ADHD and anxiety also showed less positive parenting and greater overprotectiveness than families of children with ADHD only. Overall, studies to date suggest that families of children with ADHD and anxiety exhibit the high degree of conflict found in families of children with ADHD but also characteristics of families with anxious children (e.g., overprotection).</p>
<p align="left">In addition to parent&#8211;child and family relationships, an additional common influence may be in the area of neurocognitive functioning. Numerous studies have provided support for ADHD involving diminished neurocognitive functioning in areas such as working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Martinusseen, Hayden, Hogg-Johnson, &amp; Tannock, 2005</xref>) and inhibitory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Barkley, 1997a</xref>). In addition, there is evidence that children with ADHD and anxiety may have even greater difficulties with certain neurocognitive functions such as working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Jarrett, Wolff, Davis, Cowart, &amp; Ollendick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-4" rid="c41">Tannock, 2009</xref>). In relation to anxiety, basic research supports a functional relationship between neurocognitive functioning and anxiety. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, and Calvo (2007)</xref> noted that an adverse effect of high anxiety in normal populations is difficulty with executive functions such as working memory, shifting, and inhibitory control. In addition, anxious participants completing cognitive tasks often show greater brain activation relative to nonanxious participants in brain areas related to cognitive control such as the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Santos, Wall, &amp; Eysenck, 2006</xref>). These studies suggest that participants with high levels of anxiety often have to recruit greater cognitive resources during cognitively demanding tasks, since areas such as the prefrontal cortex serve both cognitive and emotional control functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-2" rid="c3">Barkley, 1997a</xref>). In turn, symptoms of ADHD and anxiety may be influenced by a common process such as neurocognitive functioning.</p>
<p align="left">Overall, no study to date has examined processes of change in the psychosocial treatment of ADHD and anxiety, but basic research and treatment research findings suggest a need for such studies. As noted earlier, children in the MTA Study showed an enhanced response to behavioral treatment for ADHD when anxiety was present; however, little is known about why such a response might occur. In addition, other research studies have shown that symptoms of ADHD may be reduced following treatment for child anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Kendall, Brady, &amp; Verduin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Levy, Hunt, &amp; Heriot, 2007</xref>) or treatment for both ADHD and anxiety symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-2" rid="c20">Jarrett &amp; Ollendick, 2012</xref>). At the same time, many of these treatment studies have been designed to address questions relating to group outcomes rather than individual-level change. As noted by some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Barlow &amp; Nock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-2" rid="c8">Borckardt et al., 2008</xref>), single-case designs may offer unique insights into the processes of change that occur at the individual level over the course of treatment.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>Current Study</title>
<p align="left">The current single-case design study involved a 10-week treatment for children with ADHD, combined type (ADHD-C) and a comorbid anxiety disorder. Treatment involved a combination of parent management training for ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Barkley, 1997b</xref>) and family based cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Rapee, Wignall, Hudson, &amp; Schniering, 2000</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-1" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for treatment details). Although aggregate outcomes have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-3" rid="c20">Jarrett &amp; Ollendick, 2012</xref>), the current study sought to examine processes of change during the course of treatment in areas such as neurocognitive functioning, parent&#8211;child relationships, and family functioning, given that such areas have been theorized to contribute to the comorbidity of ADHD and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-4" rid="c19">Jarrett &amp; Ollendick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-5" rid="c41">Tannock, 2009</xref>).<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig1"/></p>
<p align="left">More specifically, we sought to examine slopes of change for ADHD and anxiety symptoms during treatment. We were particularly interested in the slope of change relative to the introduction of certain treatment components (e.g., the start of exposure for anxiety). In addition, we examined the temporal relationships between inattention and anxiety and between hyperactivity/impulsivity and anxiety over the course of treatment. A new approach to analyzing single-case data, Simulation Modeling Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-3" rid="c8">Borckardt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">Smith, Handler, &amp; Nash, 2010</xref>), was used to address both of these analyses. An additional goal of the study was to examine changes in parent&#8211;child and family relationships along with neurocognitive changes over treatment. Given that behavioral treatment of ADHD (e.g., parent management training) often involves the key element of improving parent&#8211;child and family relationships through processes such as &#8220;special time&#8221; and praise for positive behaviors, these variables may be important in better understanding processes of change. It should be noted that family based cognitive behavioral treatment of anxiety involves psychoeducation with parents to improve parent&#8211;child relationships with respect to child anxiety (e.g., teaching parents to encourage brave behavior rather than overprotective behavior). In turn, parent&#8211;child and family processes relevant to anxiety (e.g., parental possessiveness, family independence) may also be important to consider in relation to processes of change. In addition to parent&#8211;child and family processes, we sought to examine changes in parent-reported and laboratory-based measures of neurocognitive functioning. Finally, we also sought to examine how changes in these process variables coincided with changes in symptomatology over the course of treatment.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p align="left">As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-4" rid="c20">Jarrett and Ollendick (2012)</xref>, participants included eight children and their parent(s). Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) 8 to 12 years of age; (b) current <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM&#8211;IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) diagnosis of ADHD, combined type (ADHD-C); and (c) a comorbid <italic>DSM&#8211;IV</italic> diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SOP), or separation anxiety disorder (SAD). Exclusion criteria included (a) meeting full diagnostic criteria for an autism spectrum disorder, (b) meeting full diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder, (c) current and acute psychotic symptoms, (d) current psychosocial or medication treatment (if &lt;3 months on stable dosage) for ADHD, (e) current psychosocial or medication treatment for anxiety, (f) estimated IQ less than 80 based on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition (WISC&#8211;IV; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Wechsler, 2003</xref>), and (g) the presence of any other conditions that required treatment prior to the treatment of ADHD and anxiety. It should be noted that we utilized an IQ cutoff given the child report demands of the study and our belief that intelligence might affect the benefits of the cognitive component of treatment. A disorder was considered present if the child was assigned a clinical diagnosis during a consensus meeting utilizing findings from the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for <italic>DSM&#8211;IV</italic>: Child and Parent Versions (ADIS-C/P; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Silverman &amp; Albano, 1996</xref>).

The reliability and validity of the FES are well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-2" rid="c29">Moos &amp; Moos, 1981</xref>). Internal consistency reliability estimates for the FES subscales range from .61 to .78. Test&#8211;retest reliabilities for the subscales for 2-month, 3-month, and 12-month intervals range from .52 to .91, suggesting that the scale is reasonably stable across time. For the current study, the following scales were evaluated: Cohesion, Conflict, Expressiveness, and Independence. These factors were selected given that these domains tend to be elevated in the families of children with ADHD and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-2" rid="c24">Kepley &amp; Ostrander, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p align="left">Weekly treatment phase data were utilized for examining slope change and the temporal relationships among inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and anxiety. Neurocognitive, parent&#8211;child relationship, and family data were collected at pretreatment, midtreatment, and 1-week posttreatment. Results were analyzed using a combination of statistical approaches used in the single-case and clinical replication literature. The first set of analytic approaches was reserved for measures administered at pretreatment, midtreatment, and 1-week posttreatment. Given the small sample size and lack of a normal distribution, nonparametric tests were utilized. Friedman tests were used for measures with more than two time points. Wilcoxon tests were used for measures with two time points and for post hoc tests.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, a method for calculating &#8220;clinical significance&#8221; was also used (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-2" rid="c18">Jacobson and Truax (1991)</xref> discussed alternative ways to calculate clinical significance, including the calculation of a &#8220;reliable change index&#8221; to determine whether change reflects more than just the imprecise fluctuation of a measurement tool. In addition to this index, the authors recommended a definition for &#8220;recovery&#8221; as either moving outside of a dysfunctional population (e.g., moving 2 <italic>SD</italic>s away from the mean of the dysfunctional population) or moving within the distribution of the normal population (e.g., moving within 2 <italic>SD</italic>s of the mean of the normal population). Both definitions require that adequate norms be available for the normal and/or dysfunctional populations. Definitions for recovery in the current study were determined based on the availability of such norms. In addition, the reliable change index was only calculated in cases where test&#8211;retest reliability data were available for a given measure.</p>
<p align="left">The second approach used for single-case analysis was Simulation Modeling Analysis (SMA; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-4" rid="c8">Borckardt et al., 2008</xref>), an approach increasingly used in the single-case literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-2" rid="c39">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). SMA (Version 8.3.3) was used to analyze single-case data. Although visual inspection has often been used to analyze single case data, visual inspection is often prone to overestimation of effect size. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Matyas and Greenwood (1990)</xref> found that visual inspection led to Type I error rates or false positives from 16% to 84%. In addition, visual inspection cannot account for the fact that single-case data are autocorrelated (i.e., nonindependence of sequential ratings by the same informant). SMA allows the user to examine changes in the level of symptoms between phases (e.g., baseline and treatment). It also allows for an examination of the slope of symptom change (in terms of the correlation between the data stream and a specified slope vector) and evaluates the significance of the effect using simulation methods that take the phase length and autocorrelation of the data stream into account. SMA allows the user to test the actual data stream against standard slope vectors as well as custom slope vectors. For the current study, custom slope vectors were created, since we were interested in examining slopes in relation to the start of exposures for anxiety (i.e., the critical component of change in the treatment of anxiety). See <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc2-1" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for tested slopes. These vectors can also be represented mathematically as the following based on 10 treatment data points: (a) 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1; (b) 10 10 10 10 10 10 9 8 7 6; (c) 10 9 8 7 6 5 6 7 8 9; and (d) 10 9 8 7 6 5 5 5 5 5. When the data stream is tested against a given slope, a significant correlation indicates that a correlation as large as that found between the actual data stream and the tested slope occurs less than 5% of the time among 5,000 randomly generated data streams (with these randomly generated streams having the same number of data points and degree of autocorrelation as the original stream). Overall, this method offers a more reliable method than visual inspection and generates much lower Type I and Type II errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-5" rid="c8">Borckardt et al., 2008</xref>).<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig2"/></p>
<p align="left">SMA also allows the user to examine multivariate process change or the temporal relationship between two variables throughout the course of therapy (e.g., do ADHD symptoms change before anxiety symptoms?). This particular approach uses cross-lagged correlations between the two measures (e.g., ADHD and anxiety symptoms) and evaluates the significance of the effect using simulation methods that take the autocorrelation estimates for each lag into account. For example, the actual cross-lagged correlation in the data stream is compared to 5,000 randomly generated data streams that have similar properties to the original data stream (i.e., number of data points and degree of autocorrelation for a particular lag). An exact probability can then be estimated (e.g., how many times out of the 5,000 simulations was the cross-correlation in the actual data stream larger than the cross-correlations found in the random data streams?). SMA evaluates cross-lagged correlations from Lag &#8722;5 to Lag +5. Positive lags suggest that Variable 1 change (i.e., ADHD) precedes Variable 2 change (i.e., anxiety), while negative lags suggest that Variable 2 precedes Variable 1. Numbered lags suggest the number of weeks separating the changes (e.g., a significant correlation at Lag &#8722;2 would suggest that anxiety changes 2 weeks prior to ADHD). If a cross-correlation is positive, it suggests that changes in ADHD and anxiety are positively correlated at a given lag, while a negative correlation suggests that changes in ADHD and anxiety are negatively correlated at a given lag.</p>

<p align="left">For slope change on inattention, significantly decreasing slopes were found for identification numbers (IDs) 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7. IDs 2 and 6 showed immediate changes early in therapy, which leveled out when exposure was introduced, while ID 7 showed a consistent linear decline over time. IDs 1 and 5 showed patterns that may have related to the introduction of exposure. ID 1 showed limited change prior to exposure but a more substantial decline following exposure, while ID 5 showed an initial decline followed by an increase in inattention following exposure. It should be noted that even nonsignificant slopes all showed a declining trend.</p>
<p align="left">For slope change on hyperactivity/impulsivity, significantly decreasing slopes were found for IDs 2 and 7. ID 2 showed an immediate decline early in therapy which leveled out when exposure was introduced. ID 7 showed a gradual linear decline. These changes reflected the same patterns of change on inattention for these two cases. It should be noted that even nonsignificant slopes all showed a declining trend, with most slopes involving gradual decline.</p>
<p align="left">For slope changes on anxiety, decreasing slopes were found for IDs 1, 2, 7, and 8. IDs 1 and 8 showed limited changes prior to exposure but a decline after exposure. ID 2 showed a decline in anxiety prior to exposure, which then leveled out following exposure. ID 7 showed an increase in anxiety prior to exposure but a decrease after exposure. Overall, three of the four patterns reflected a change in slope (i.e., increased gains) following the introduction of exposure. In addition, these patterns in anxiety change mirrored the same significant patterns of change for inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity for each case with the exception of ID 7. As noted earlier, ID 7 showed gradual linear decline for inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. For anxiety, though, symptoms increased prior to exposure but declined afterwards. It should be noted that even nonsignificant slopes all showed a declining trend.</p>
<p align="left">For the temporal relations between inattention and anxiety, a number of relationships were found ranging from positive and negative significant lags of &#8722;2 to +5. Overall, though, the data generally reflected significant positive lags (i.e., 4 out of 8 cases; 50%), suggesting that ADHD symptom change typically preceded anxiety symptom change (although not always in terms of a positive correlation). For symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity and anxiety, a more consistent pattern emerged. In four of the eight cases (IDs 2, 3, 5, 8), a positive correlation at Lag 0 indicated three possibilities: (a) hyperactivity/impulsivity and anxiety symptoms increased concurrently at some lag, (b) hyperactivity/impulsivity and anxiety symptoms decreased concurrently at some lag, or (c) both occurred. In one of the eight cases (ID 1), a positive correlation at Lag +1 indicated three possibilities: (a) an increase in hyperactivity/impulsivity preceded an increase in anxiety symptoms by 1 week at some lag, (b) a decrease in hyperactivity/impulsivity preceded a decrease in anxiety symptoms by 1 week at some lag, or (c) both occurred. Overall, these data suggest that for 62.5% (5 of 8) of our study participants, hyperactivity/impulsivity and anxiety symptoms tended to generally change concurrently (Lag range of 0 to +1).</p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-1" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> presents neurocognitive data for each subject on the BRIEF and the CNSVS. At pretreatment, eight of eight (100%) of participants were in the clinical range on BRIEF Working Memory (i.e., <italic>T</italic> score &#8805; 65), suggesting significant working memory deficits at pretreatment based on parent report. To examine changes over treatment, a Friedman test (<italic>n</italic> = 6) was conducted on pretreatment, midtreatment, and 1-week posttreatment maternal ratings of neurocognitive functioning. No changes were found for Working Memory at the groups level, &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 6) = 1.13, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. Clinically significant change was also examined at the individual level. An analysis of <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-2" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> at the individual level suggests that three of eight (37.5%) participants fell into the Recovered range at pretreatment (i.e., <italic>T</italic> scores &lt; 70, according to a 2 <italic>SD</italic> solution). One participant showed reliable change from pretreatment to midtreatment (ID 2), and three participants showed reliable change from pretreatment to posttreatment (IDs 5, 6, and 8). It should be noted that ID 6 moved in the direction of deterioration. Overall, only ID 8 showed reliable change and was categorized in the Recovered range at posttreatment. <xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl2"/></p>
<p align="left">On the CNSVS, greater variability in cognitive functioning was found at pretreatment. Based on CNSVS range definitions for Complex Attention, two of eight (25%) children were in the Above Average range (&gt;109), three of eight (37.5%) were in the Average range (90&#8211;109), one of eight (12.5%) was in the Low Average range (80&#8211;89), and two of eight (25%) were in the Low range. Based on CNSVS range definitions for Cognitive Flexibility, two of eight (25%) children were in the Above Average range (&gt;109), four of eight (50%) were in the Average range (90&#8211;109), one of eight (12.5%) was in the Low Average range (80&#8211;89), and one of eight (12.5%) was in the Low range. To examine changes over treatment, a Wilcoxon test (<italic>n</italic> = 7) was conducted on pretreatment and 1-week posttreatment CNSVS scores. No changes were found for Complex Attention from pretreatment to 1-week posttreatment at the group level (<italic>T</italic> = 9, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) or for Cognitive Flexibility from pretreatment to 1-week posttreatment at the group level (<italic>T</italic> = 6, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).

<p align="left"><xref ref-type="table" id="tbc3-1" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> presents parent&#8211;child relationship and parenting data from pretreatment through 1 week posttreatment. Wilcoxon tests (<italic>n</italic> = 8) revealed no differences between pretreatment and 1-week posttreatment for child-reported parental Possessiveness at the group level (<italic>T</italic> = 12, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). To examine changes for parent-reported Possessiveness, a Friedman test (<italic>n</italic> = 6) was conducted on pretreatment, midtreatment, and 1-week posttreatment maternal ratings. No changes were found for Possessiveness for mothers at the group level, &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 6) = 2.00, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05.

<p align="left">For the PCRQ, an analysis of <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc3-2" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> at the individual level suggests that zero of eight participants fell into the Recovered range at pretreatment for mother report (i.e., scores &#8804; 10.4 according to a 2 <italic>SD</italic> solution). On maternal report, IDs 1, 5, and 7 showed trends for improvement, although only ID 7 was classified in the Recovered range at posttreatment. Overall, ID 7 appeared to show the most evidence for improvement on parent-reported Possessiveness. For child report of Possessiveness, zero of eight participants fell into the Recovered range at pretreatment (i.e., scores &#8804; 14.3 according to a 2 <italic>SD</italic> solution). On child report, IDs 2 and 3 showed trends for improvement, and IDs 4, 5, 6, and 7 showed trends for deterioration. No child fell into the Recovered range at posttreatment.</p>

For maternal report, no participant showed reliable change from pretreatment to midtreatment, but one participant (ID 8) showed reliable change from pretreatment to posttreatment that coincided with movement into the Recovered range. Overall, few changes were found for positive parenting with the exception of ID 8.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, family environmental changes were assessed via the FES for the Cohesion, Conflict, Expressiveness, and Independence scales. Data for family related changes are reported in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc4-1" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>. For maternal report, Friedman tests did not reveal a significant difference for any of the FES factors, although there was a trend for an increase in independence (<italic>p</italic> = .06). An analysis of <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc4-2" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> suggests that reliable change was found on Cohesion for IDs 4 and 6. It should be noted that most participants were relatively high on Cohesion at pretreatment (i.e., classified in the Recovered range at pretreatment). A similar picture emerged for Conflict. IDs 1, 4, and 6 showed reliable change in Conflict across treatment, but many families were classified in the Recovered range at pretreatment. For Control, few instances of reliable change were found (with the exception of ID 2 showing increasing Control), but again, many families were considered to be in the Recovered range at pretreatment. Finally, IDs 6 and 8 showed an increase in Independence across treatment while ID 4 showed a decline at midtreatment.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p align="left">The current study sought to examine processes of change in the treatment of children with ADHD and anxiety. The first goal of the study was to examine the slope of change for symptoms along with the temporal relationships among inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and anxiety over the course of treatment. The second goal was to explore changes in neuropsychological functioning, parent&#8211;child relationships, and family functioning.</p>
<p align="left">In relation to the first goal, we found declining slopes for inattention in a large number of cases but fewer significant declining slopes for hyperactivity/impulsivity (although trends for decline were noted). These significant slopes typically involved gradual decline that did not seem to be related to the introduction of exposure, although there were exceptions with IDs 1 and 5. In relation to anxiety, there was greater evidence that exposure was potentially related to additional gains, since three of four cases (IDs 1, 7, and 8) showed anxiety-related gains that appeared to coincide with the introduction of exposure activities. Interestingly, for ID 1, exposure appeared to coincide with a reduction in both inattention and anxiety. This finding is interesting, given speculation that one possible reason for ADHD and anxiety comorbidity is how anxiety disrupts attentional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-7" rid="c41">Tannock, 2009</xref>); however, this finding was specific to ID 1. Different patterns were found for other cases. For example, early gains for ID 2 were found for inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and anxiety with little additional benefit following the introduction of exposures, suggesting that early treatment elements (e.g., positive attention and praise) may have affected all three of these domains. Overall, these trends point to the significant heterogeneity in the process of treatment response within this population.</p>
<p align="left">With regard to temporal relationships across treatment in general, symptoms of anxiety and hyperactivity/impulsivity tended to change concurrently over the course of treatment for around 62.5% of our sample. This relationship was not found for anxiety symptoms and inattention, though (with the exception of ID1). In many cases, ADHD symptom change preceded anxiety symptom change. This finding may not be surprising, since the active treatment components for ADHD (i.e., positive attention and praise, rewards) were delivered prior to the active ingredient for anxiety (i.e., exposure). At the same time, one might expect these early treatment elements to be more effective for hyperactivity/impulsivity than inattention, since behavioral strategies are thought to be more effective for discrete, disruptive behaviors. Overall, the strong relationship between anxiety and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptom change is interesting and worthy of future study. For example, the MTA Study found that the presence of parent-reported child anxiety moderated treatment outcomes <italic>only</italic> for parent-reported hyperactivity/impulsivity (but not inattention) and internalizing problems. In turn, our results are consistent with that finding. For some of our cases (e.g., ID 2), it appeared that changes in these domains occurred outside of the introduction of exposure, which is consistent with the finding of reduced hyperactivity/impulsivity and internalizing problems with this population in the MTA Study. In relation to the finding of anxiety and hyperactivity/impulsivity covarying across treatment, it is unclear whether such a relationship is due to parental perceptions regarding anxiety and hyperactivity/impulsivity or whether there is a true functional relationship between anxiety and hyperactivity/impulsivity where behavioral treatment results in concurrent changes in these symptom domains. For example, these domains might covary due to worry about the consequences of disruptive behavior (e.g., parent being upset about child being out of seat). Alternatively, it may be that anxiety treatment components help reduce anxiety, which reduces hyperactivity/impulsivity. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-2" rid="c23">Kendall et al. (2001)</xref> speculated that a change in overlapping symptoms may have accounted for the ADHD reductions they saw in their treatment study of child anxiety (e.g., relaxation training helping a child to reduce excessive fidgeting). In addition, one the most common physiological consequences of anxiety for children (particularly GAD) has been found to be &#8220;can&#8217;t sit still and relax&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Pina, Silverman, Alfano, &amp; Saavedra, 2002</xref>). Overall, the current results suggest that multiple pathways may have occurred in the context of treatment, since some children showed early treatment changes in both areas (e.g., ID2), while others tended to show changes in both areas somewhat later in treatment (e.g., ID8).</p>
<p align="left">In relation to neurocognitive functioning, parent-reported neurocognitive deficits on the BRIEF were reported for all participants at pretreatment, but few clinically significant changes were noted across treatment (with the exception of ID 8). On the CNSVS, neurocognitive deficits were more variable at pretreatment, with some children in the average to above average range and other children in the low range. No clinically significant changes were found across time points. Firstly, our finding of greater deficits on the BRIEF in comparison to laboratory tasks is consistent with discrepancies found between report-based versus laboratory task measures of executive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">McAuley, Chen, Goos, Schachar, &amp; Crosbie, 2010</xref>). Regardless of this discrepancy, the lack of clinically significant changes in neurocognitive functioning on either measure points to the potential need for more focused interventions that are closer to brain functioning (e.g., stimulant medication, cognitive training) to intervene on the neurocognitive difficulties of children with ADHD and anxiety. For example, stimulant medication treatments have shown evidence for changes (at least in the short-term) in neuropsychological functioning domains such as sustained attention and inhibitory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Epstein et al., 2006</xref>) and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Bedard, Jain, Hogg-Johnson, &amp; Tannock, 2007</xref>). In addition, emerging research on cognitive training approaches such as working memory training have shown evidence for neuropsychological improvements in areas such as working memory in both short and longer term follow-ups (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Holmes et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Finally, we sought to examine changes in parent&#8211;child relationships, parenting, and family functioning over treatment. In relation to parent&#8211;child relationships and parenting, some trends for improvement were found for parental possessiveness, although the lack of available test&#8211;retest reliability data on the PCRQ precluded the opportunity to examine reliable change. No changes were found for child-reported possessiveness. Overall, there was limited evidence for movement into the Recovered range, although this was seen for ID 7 parent report. In addition, the lack of normative data for the PCRQ may have resulted in a stricter definition of Recovery for the PCRQ. In terms of positive parenting, few families were within the Recovered range at pretreatment, although many were close to the Recovered range. Only one family showed reliable change and movement into the Recovered range (ID 8). Overall, limited changes were found for parent&#8211;child relationship and parenting changes over treatment.</p>
<p align="left">In relation to family functioning, there was evidence found for an increase in Cohesion (IDs 4 and 6), a decrease in Conflict (IDs 1, 4, and 6), and increases in Independence (IDs 6 and 8). Overall, though, such changes were not found for the majority of families, and such changes did not always coincide with other changes (e.g., changes in symptomatology). At the same time, though, there generally appeared to be greater evidence for family related changes than parenting and parent&#8211;child relationship changes.</p>
<p align="left">Although the current study provides some initial data on mechanisms of change in the treatment of ADHD and anxiety, some limitations must be noted. Firstly, our analyses of symptomatology were restricted to parent report, only. In turn, it is unclear whether the concurrent changes between anxiety and hyperactivity/impulsivity reflect true symptom covariation or whether parents might view these symptom domains in a similar manner. At the same time, our finding of concurrent change tended to be specific to hyperactivity/impulsivity, so it does not appear to reflect a general tendency for parents to report improvement or decline in all symptom domains. Another limitation is that discrete behaviors were not measured in the current study, so it is unclear as to whether the true frequency of behaviors changed (in contrast to parent&#8217;s ability to manage behaviors or their perception of the behaviors). Another limitation of the current study is that a number of variables were not measured on a weekly basis (e.g., neurocognitive functioning, parenting). In turn, single-cases analyses could not be conducted to explore the temporal relationships between symptomatology and these domains. Finally, as with all single-case design studies, our small sample size limits the generalizability of our findings to the population of children with ADHD and anxiety.</p>
<p align="left">Overall, the current study provides a unique examination of processes of change over the course of a treatment designed specifically for children with ADHD and comorbid anxiety. Our findings point toward the significant heterogeneity that is found in the process of change in therapy, a topic worthy of future study for treatment studies in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-2" rid="c5">Barlow &amp; Nock, 2009</xref>). Importantly, future treatment research should consider different levels of analysis in relation to change. For example, the current treatment was designed to primarily address symptom impairment (e.g., completing chores and homework, a child sleeping in his or her own bed). While evidence for changes in symptoms and symptom impairment have been reported for this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-6" rid="c20">Jarrett &amp; Ollendick, 2012</xref>), the current study suggests that some of the expected mediators (e.g., changes in parent&#8211;child relationships) did not appear to be related to such changes. In relation to past studies, our sample was somewhat more impaired in relation to aspects such as positive parenting. For example, our pretreatment mean of 19 for positive parenting was well below the mean reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-6" rid="c33">Pfiffner and McBurnett (2006)</xref> for children with ADHD and anxiety (i.e., <italic>M</italic> = 24.1). It may be that more intensive and longer interventions are needed to change the entrenched parent&#8211;child relationship and parenting influences in these families. At the same time, more evidence was found for family level changes in areas such as cohesion, conflict, and independence, with the greatest evidence for changes in independence.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, there was almost no evidence for changes in neuropsychological functioning. In turn, it may be that treatments that are &#8220;closer&#8221; to the neurobiological substrate (e.g., stimulant medication, cognitive training) would also be needed to address neuropsychological deficits in this population. At the same time, current research has shown that stimulant treatment for children with ADHD and anxiety often results in improvements in ADHD but not changes in anxiety symptoms at the group level (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Abikoff et al., 2005</xref>). At the individual level, though, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-2" rid="c1">Abikoff et al. (2005)</xref> did find some children who responded to stimulant medication for both ADHD and anxiety symptoms. Future stimulant medication studies might be able to offer unique examinations of the temporal relationships between ADHD and anxiety symptoms over the course of stimulant treatment, since symptom change might be more tightly coupled with stimulant medication treatment than behavioral treatment (i.e., the intervention is more closely related to symptoms than psychosocial treatment). Given that certain treatments seem to offer unique benefits, in future studies, researchers might consider combined approaches (e.g., stimulant medication in addition to family based treatment or cognitive training in combination with family based treatment) to maximize treatment gains for children with ADHD and anxiety.</p>
