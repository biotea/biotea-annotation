<p align="left">The issue of competence is not new to practicing psychologists who strive to operate within their professional boundaries. However, within the field of applied sport psychology, a satisfactory answer to the question, &#8220;What is competence?&#8221; is not readily available. As <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr81-1" rid="c81">Taylor (1994)</xref> stated, &#8220;no agency or organization has provided a specific and clear definition of competence that may be used within the field of applied sport psychology&#8221; (p. 190). This lack of clarity persists, despite the fact that competence is central to the Association of Applied Sport Psychology&#8217;s (AASP) ethics code: &#8220;AASP members maintain the highest standards of competence in their work. They recognize the boundaries of their professional competencies and the limitations of their expertise&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">AASP, 2012a</xref>). Furthermore, the importance of accountability (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr76-1" rid="c76">Smith, 1989</xref>) remains critical in applied sport psychology as the field continues to develop and mature. Despite this observation, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Andersen (2005)</xref> remarked that &#8220;&#8230; there are so many ways to be a poor sport psychologist &#8230; there are so many errors you can make &#8230; all sport psychologists aren&#8217;t the same. There are some more competent than others&#8221; (p. 15).</p>
<p align="left">In terms of the current training and development of applied sport psychologists, practitioners traditionally have backgrounds in kinesiology or psychology. For the past three decades, this dichotomy has manifested itself in debates in the literature about which pathway is more appropriate&#8212;or even more important&#8212;in the training and development of applied sport psychologists. Indeed, practitioners&#8217; disciplinary proclivities led to the founding in 1985 of the Association for the Advancement of Applied Sport Psychology (renamed AASP in 2006) and in 1986 of the American Psychological Association&#8217;s (APA) Division 47: Exercise and Sport Psychology. What is important in the context of the present article is that, in 1989, AASP established and approved criteria for certification intended to demonstrate that individuals must obtain a minimum level of training and experience to provide professional services in applied sport psychology. In 2005, APA Division 47 developed a sport psychology knowledge and skills self-assessment checklist intended to assist practitioners in assessing their knowledge and skills in terms of proficiency criteria. Despite, or maybe because of these developments, the debates about educational background have continued to the present day.</p>
<p align="left">If applied sport psychology is to become an accountable field, it must gain a better understanding of competence and its implications for the training and development of practitioners. In this article, we discuss the notion of competence in applied sport psychology via the review, synthesis, and transfer of the competence literature in the broader field of professional psychology. To this end, the narrative focuses on defining and understanding competence, delineating competencies and their emergence in applied sport psychology, the conceptualization of a competency model and its implications for applied sport psychology, and professional development and lifelong learning in applied sport psychology. We conclude with policy recommendations for further developing a competency-based understanding of the training and development of applied sport psychologists.</p>

<title>Competence in Professional Psychology</title>
<p align="left">In contrast to the applied sport psychology literature, professional psychology has for some time discussed and debated the nature of competence in the profession. Indeed, competence has been recognized as a central principle and value that underpins service delivery and is &#8220;of vital importance for all psychologists&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Barnett, Doll, Younggren, &amp; Rubin, 2007</xref>, p. 510). Psychologists are mandated to practice exclusively within the boundaries of their competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">APA, 2002</xref>), and professional organizations have established policies, guidelines, and standards to regulate the development, certification, and maintenance of competence.</p>
<p align="left">Since the turn of the century, a &#8220;competency movement&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-1" rid="c70">Rubin et al., 2007</xref>, p. 452) within psychology has gathered momentum, leading the profession toward competency-based models, education, training, and credentialing. A major development in the competency movement was the organization of the 2002 Competencies Conference: Future Directions in Education and Credentialing in Professional Psychology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">Kaslow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-1" rid="c52">Kaslow et al., 2004</xref>). The primary goals of the conference were to further clarify issues related to the identification, education and training, and assessment of competencies within professional psychology. Conference attendees focused on several competency areas, and conference papers discussing these areas were published in special issues of <italic>Journal of Clinical Psychology</italic> and <italic>Professional Psychology: Research and Practice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">Arredondo, Shealy, Neale, &amp; Winfrey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Bieschke, Fouad, Collins, &amp; Halonen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Daniel, Roysircar, Abeles, &amp; Boyd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">de las Fuentes, Willmuth, &amp; Yarrow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Elman, Illfelder-Kaye, &amp; Robiner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Falender et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1" rid="c54">Krishnamurthy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-1" rid="c68">Roberts, Borden, Christiansen, &amp; Lopez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-1" rid="c69">Rodolfa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr77-1" rid="c77">Spruill et al., 2004</xref>). Also building on the Competencies Conference, the APA convened a task force in 2003; a major objective of the task force was to understand the assessment of competence within professional psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-1" rid="c55">Leigh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-1" rid="c56">Lichtenberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1" rid="c53">Kaslow et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-2" rid="c70">Rubin et al., 2007</xref>). Collectively, these developments within professional psychology have resulted in a shift to a culture that emphasizes the acquisition and maintenance of competence as a primary objective and that promotes the assessment of competence at all levels over time. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-2" rid="c68">Roberts et al. (2005)</xref> described this zeitgeist as a &#8220;culture of competence&#8221; (p. 356) and <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-2" rid="c55">Leigh et al. (2007)</xref> concluded that &#8220;the gold standard [for a psychologist] is to demonstrate competency&#8221; (p. 463).</p>

<title>Defining and Understanding Competence</title>
<p align="left">In the mid 1990s, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr81-2" rid="c81">Taylor (1994)</xref> stated that &#8220;a more rigorous delineation of competence is needed within the field of applied sport psychology&#8221; (p. 190); over a decade later, because this delineation was still notably absent from the literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr89-1" rid="c89">Tod, Marchant, and Andersen (2007)</xref> observed that &#8220;competence has not been explicitly defined in the [applied sport psychology] literature&#8221; (p. 318) and <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr102-1" rid="c102">Wylleman, Harwood, Elbe, and de Caluw&#233; (2009)</xref> more recently remarked that a &#8220;clear need [exists] for a competency-based approach [in applied sport psychology]&#8221; (p. 444).</p>
<p align="left">Drawing on its Latin roots&#8212;<italic>competens</italic>, meaning to &#8220;be fit or proper&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Competent, 2005</xref>)&#8212;<italic>competence</italic> can be broadly understood to mean &#8220;a sufficiency of means for the necessities and conveniences of life&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Competence, 2008</xref>). Within the professional psychology literature, a wide range of definitions of competence exist. An examination of all these perspectives is beyond our scope, but <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Epstein and Hundert&#8217;s (2002)</xref> widely cited definition, derived from medicine, is worth discussing in detail. They conceived professional competence as &#8220;the habitual and judicious use of communication, knowledge, technical skills, clinical reasoning, emotions, values, and reflection in daily practice for the benefit of the individual and community being served&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-2" rid="c33">Epstein &amp; Hundert, 2002</xref>, p. 227). This definition captures the essence of competence, and refers to an individual&#8217;s overall suitability for a profession, reflecting his or her knowledge, skills, and attitudes and their integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-3" rid="c70">Rubin et al., 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr102-2" rid="c102">Wylleman et al., 2009</xref>). In its application to psychology, competence involves understanding and performing tasks consistent with one&#8217;s professional qualifications, sensitive to cultural and individual differences, and anchored to evidence-based practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">APA Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Competence is not a static end point that one achieves, nor should it be viewed in a dichotomous manner. Hence, practitioners should not be described as being either competent or incompetent, but rather as being on a continuum, ranging from low to high levels of competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-2" rid="c16">Barnett et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to the preponderance of effective practice literature in applied sport psychology (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr85-1" rid="c85">Tod &amp; Andersen, 2005</xref>), this perspective focuses not solely on the outcome of the consultancy process&#8212;that is, effective versus ineffective practice (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Anderson, Miles, Robinson, &amp; Mahoney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Cropley, Miles, Hanton, &amp; Niven, 2007</xref>)&#8212;but rather on the various components of competence and where they lie on a continuum. Furthermore, sport psychology&#8722;related organizations have tended to specify minimum levels of competence rather than indicating areas of training that require specific attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr81-3" rid="c81">Taylor, 1994</xref>) or continued development (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr84-1" rid="c84">Tod, 2007</xref>). This approach persists despite competence being perceived as both an enforceable standard and an aspirational principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-3" rid="c16">Barnett et al., 2007</xref>). More specifically, there are minimum acceptable standards of practice that must be met for psychologists to be considered to be practicing ethically, and there is a need to strive for a goal throughout one&#8217;s career that is never fully achieved.</p>
<p align="left">Psychologists should be competent to work with a wide range of individuals, and they should consider each individual&#8217;s particular characteristics, needs, and circumstances when providing services (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-4" rid="c16">Barnett et al., 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr75-1" rid="c75">Silva, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr78-1" rid="c78">Stapleton, 2010</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr81-4" rid="c81">Taylor (1994)</xref> pointed out that whether or not a sport psychologist has been trained in kinesiology or psychology, there is no guarantee that his or her training will make him or her competent to practice with a particular client group in sports. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Brown, Gould, and Foster (2005)</xref> contributed to and extended this discussion when they highlighted the importance of contextual intelligence, or &#8220;practical know-how&#8221; (p. 51), in the provision of sport psychology services. This focus has important practical day-to-day implications for applied sport psychologists because they must have exposure to a variety of relevant clients and they must purposely reflect on their experiences. Hence, competence is both developmental and contextual in nature, and is reflected in applied practice as a dynamic, situational-specific phenomenon. Although it is tempting to think of competence in terms of &#8220;overall or integrated professional abilities&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-2" rid="c52">Kaslow et al., 2004</xref>, p. 708), it is important to recognize that many discrete competencies are required to perform most professional tasks, including those relating to applied sport psychology.</p>

<title>Delineating Competencies and Their Emergence in Applied Sport Psychology</title>
<p align="left">Competencies are complex and dynamically interactive clusters of integrated knowledge, skills, and abilities; behaviors and strategies; attitudes, beliefs, and values; dispositions and personal characteristics; self-perceptions; and motivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-1" rid="c61">Mentkowski &amp; Associates, 2000</xref>) that enable an individual to execute a professional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-1" rid="c59">Marrelli, 1998</xref>). Competencies involve the whole person and are identifiable; derived by experts; measurable, acquirable, flexible, and transferable; can be evaluated against standards; are required for sustained effective performance; and should be continually reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">Alverno College Faculty, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr65-1" rid="c65">Parry, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-1" rid="c79">Stratford, 1994</xref>). For practicing sport psychologists, it is important that they are aware that a minimum threshold of competencies is required to practice safely and effectively, whereas a paragon of performance excellence is reflected in a high level of proficiency across multiple competencies.</p>
<p align="left">As noted earlier, in 1989, AASP established and approved criteria for certification intended to demonstrate that individuals seeking certification must have obtained a minimum level of training and experience to provide professional services in applied sport psychology. The current AASP certification criteria focus on the courses of study completed by the trainee and mentored experience (see Table 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">AASP, 2012b</xref>). Although AASP has been influential in the development of applied sport psychology as a profession, its predominately curriculum-based method of certification is not without its limitations. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">Aoyagi, Portenga, Poczwardowski, Cohen, and Statler (2012)</xref> recently noted that this approach is not adequate for professional certification and does not distinguish performance-based work from therapeutically based work with athletes.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl1"/></p>
<p align="left">In 2003, the International Society of Sport Psychology (ISSP) Managing Council supported the publication of a position stand on competencies and their accomplishment in sport and exercise psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr82-1" rid="c82">Tenenbaum, Lidor, Papaianou, &amp; Samulski, 2003</xref>). A conceptual scheme emphasizing knowledge-based standards, practice standards, and supervised experience standards was presented (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-2" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Despite the advances this work makes toward an understanding of competence in applied sport psychology, it is unclear how the list of competencies was developed. It appears that the scheme was based on <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr82-2" rid="c82">Tenenbaum et al.&#8217;s (2003)</xref> personal and collective experiences rather than on any empirical survey methods or widespread consensus of opinion. Furthermore, the authors acknowledged that the list of competencies they presented was not conclusive or exhaustive and that they should be viewed as &#8220;recommendations&#8221; for the education of sport and exercise psychologists. Indeed, rather vaguely, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr82-3" rid="c82">Tenenbaum et al. (2003)</xref> remarked that &#8220;each individual, group, institution, or nation is free to use any one or set of the competencies listed here, and choose any course of education to meet its goals and/or views&#8221; (p. 156).</p>
<p align="left">As previously mentioned, in 2005, APA Division 47 developed a sport psychology self-assessment checklist intended to assist practitioners in assessing their knowledge and skills in terms of proficiency criteria. The checklist was split into three main areas: specialized knowledge, knowledge of persons and groups, and skills (see Table 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">APA, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-2" rid="c11">Aoyagi et al. (2012)</xref> observed that the APA Division 47 proficiency criteria are similar to the AASP certification criteria and, as such, suffer from the same limitations. Specifically, they noted that the criteria were intended to educate psychologists about a unique subfield rather than to identify to the public individuals qualified to practice sport psychology, and the criteria did not distinguish performance-based work from therapeutically based work with athletes.</p>
<p align="left">In the first study to explore competencies in applied sport psychology, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr96-1" rid="c96">Ward, Sandstedt, Cox, and Beck (2005)</xref> identified essential counseling competencies for psychologists who work with athlete clients. Expert clinical sport psychologists evaluated the content validity of 33 counseling competency statements and identified 17 essential athlete-counseling competencies. These essential competencies were grouped as attitudes/beliefs, skills, or knowledge (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-4" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The findings prompted the researchers to call for the development of training curricula capable of producing competent clinical sport psychologists. They concluded that &#8220;there are currently no recognized athlete-counseling competencies for students and psychologists . . . . If sport psychology is to continue to evolve as a specialty area within professional psychology, the importance of athlete-counseling training and practice standards cannot be underestimated&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr96-2" rid="c96">Ward et al., 2005</xref>, p. 330).</p>
<p align="left">From the preceding commentary, one can conclude that the training and development documentation currently available for applied sport psychologists does not adequately prepare trainees in all the necessary competencies (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-3" rid="c11">Aoyagi et al., 2012</xref>). At least six generic limitations can be applied to this literature:
<list list-type="arabic">
<list-item><label>1</label><p align="left">Some pertinent competencies are missing. For example, the AASP certification and APA Division 47 proficiency criteria fail to include reflective practice and self-care, both of which have been identified as critical competencies for applied sport psychologists (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Andersen, Van Raalte, &amp; Brewer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Cropley, Hanton, Miles, &amp; Niven, 2010</xref>) and professional psychologists (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-1" rid="c64">Norcross, 2000</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><label>2</label><p align="left">Some important competencies are superficially described. For example, the AASP certification and APA Division 47 proficiency criteria include professional values and ethics, but neither addresses issues relating to deportment or professional identity in sufficient detail (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-2" rid="c38">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">Friedman &amp; Kaslow, 1986</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><label>3</label><p align="left">The competencies are not broken down into their subcompetencies. For example, the ISSP Managing Council&#8217;s position stand (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr82-4" rid="c82">Tenenbaum et al., 2003</xref>) covers various aspects of scientific knowledge and methods, but does not break this competency down into critical subcompetencies, such as scientific mindedness, scientific foundation of psychology, or the scientific foundation of professional practice (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-2" rid="c32">Elman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-3" rid="c38">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><label>4</label><p align="left">There is no definition of a specific competency (i.e., a description of what it is), its essential components (i.e., what a competency comprises), or its behavioral anchors (i.e., how a competency is displayed and demonstrated). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr96-3" rid="c96">Ward et al.&#8217;s (2005)</xref> essential counseling competencies allude to maintaining effective relationships, but there is no attempt to define this competency (e.g., relate effectively and meaningfully with individuals, groups, and/or communities), identify its essential components (e.g., interpersonal relationships, affective skills, expressive skills), or outline its behavioral anchors (e.g., demonstrates skills verbally and nonverbally, accepts and implements supervisory feedback nondefensively; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-4" rid="c38">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><label>5</label><p align="left">There is an overemphasis on topic areas within applied sport psychology rather than on developmentally staged competencies and their associated behavioral anchors. For example, the APA Division 47 proficiency criteria mention psychological skills training, team building, and the development of self-confidence, but fail to state how the development of knowledge, skills, and attitude can be expected and observed of trainees at different stages of training (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-3" rid="c32">Elman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-5" rid="c38">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><label>6</label><p align="left">There is an overreliance on unidimensional self-assessment rather than on multitrait, multimethod, and multi-informant approaches to assessment. For example, the APA Division 47 proficiency criteria involve trainees rating themselves on a checklist and does not involve any other methods of assessing professional competence, such as assessment of attitudes and values, oral examinations, decision-tree analysis, computer-based assessments, assessments of problem solving in standardized simulated environment, or 360&#176; evaluations, which gather feedback from multiple raters (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-2" rid="c53">Kaslow et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-3" rid="c55">Leigh et al., 2007</xref>).</p></list-item>

<title>Conceptualization of a Competency Model and Its Implications for Applied Sport Psychology</title>
<p align="left">At the Competencies Conference in 2002, a working group developed a tripartite, &#8220;cube&#8221; model of competence in professional psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-2" rid="c69">Rodolfa et al., 2005</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-1" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that includes two orthogonal competency domains: foundational and functional. Foundational (or core) competency domains are considered &#8220;the building blocks of what psychologists do&#8221; (p. 350), and they include reflective practice and self-assessment, scientific knowledge and methods, relationships, ethical and legal standards and policy issues, individual and cultural diversity, and interdisciplinary systems. Functional (or specialty) competency domains comprise &#8220;the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to perform the work of a psychologist&#8221; (p. 351), and they include, assessment, diagnosis, and case conceptualization; intervention; consultation; research and evaluation; supervision and teaching; as well as management and administration. The third axis of the cube depicts the psychologists&#8217; stage of professional development during which the domains of competency are developed: doctoral education, doctoral internship or residency, postdoctoral supervision, residency or fellowship, and continuing competency. The cube model offers a conceptual framework for understanding both foundational and functional competency domains in the development of a professional psychologist. In extending the model, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1" rid="c44">Hatcher and Lassiter (2007)</xref> developed the Practicum Competencies Outline, which specifically focuses on practicum training and summarizes the competency domains and expected levels of competence at this stage of professional development; and <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-6" rid="c38">Fouad et al. (2009)</xref> presented benchmarks for the core foundational and functional competencies in professional psychology across three levels of professional development: readiness for practicum, readiness for internship, and readiness for entry to practice. Furthermore, Fouad et al. added three new competencies to the cube model: professionalism, teaching, and advocacy.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig1"/></p>
<p align="left">Of particular relevance to the field of applied sport psychology is that the cube model assumes that although the foundational and functional domains themselves will not differ from one subdiscipline or specialty of psychology to another, the way in which these domains are shaped will vary by particular configurations of the parameters of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-3" rid="c69">Rodolfa et al., 2005</xref>). These include the populations served; problems addressed; procedures or theoretical orientations used; and settings, systems, and contexts within which the practice occurs. The specialty-specific nature of the model&#8217;s application was recognized by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-2" rid="c56">Lichtenberg et al. (2007)</xref> who highlighted differences among practice specialties regarding the specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes associated within each competency domain. Indeed, the cube model has been successfully applied to clinical neuropsychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-1" rid="c67">Rey-Casserly, Roper, &amp; Bauer, 2012</xref>), forensic psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr95-1" rid="c95">Varela &amp; Conroy, 2012</xref>), clinical child psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1" rid="c50">Jackson, Wu, Aylward, &amp; Roberts, 2012</xref>), geropsychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-1" rid="c62">Molinari, 2012</xref>), and group specialty (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">Barlow, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">With these points in mind, the cube model has a number of important policy, regulatory, and educational implications for applied sport psychology. First, a shift is required from topic areas to delineating the domains of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values that serve as the foundation required of applied sport psychologists, the domains of functional competencies that broadly define what applied sport psychologists do, and the stages of professional development and lifelong learning. To elaborate, rather than isolated groups of scholars or ad hoc committees proposing checklist-based criteria, multiple organizations should work in partnership and commission a systematic research program to explicate the aforementioned foundational and functional competencies in the specialty domain of applied sport psychology. Furthermore, by also underwriting an international conference specific to competence in applied sport psychology, the findings of this research can be discussed by a range of stakeholders, and a consensus could be reached in this area. A second important implication of the cube model is that each competency needs to be defined first, then broken into its essential components, and then behavioral anchors defined for each essential component that demonstrate the threshold for competent performance at that level of training. Consistent patterns and trends are beginning to form around the knowledge, skills, and attitudes associated within each competency domain (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-7" rid="c38">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>). Despite this, as noted in the previous section, current training and development documentation in applied sport psychology either omit some pertinent competencies, superficially describe them, or fail to break them down into their subcompetencies.</p>
<p align="left">Within applied sport psychology, the AASP certification and APA Division 47 proficiency criteria overlook reflective practice; but an important overarching competency for any psychologist is the related concept of metacompetence. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr98-1" rid="c98">Weinert (2001)</xref> made the distinction between metaknowledge (knowing what one knows and what one does not know) and metacompetencies (the ability to judge the availability, use, and learnability of personal competencies). For example, a professional psychologist&#8217;s metaknowledge might involve being aware of the range and limits of what he or she knows, whereas metacompetencies might involve the ability to recognize whether he or she is able to acquire new or missing skills. The development of metaknowledge and metacompetencies depend on self-awareness, self-reflection, and self-assessment, because introspection is fundamental to the development of professional competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Falender &amp; Shafranske, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-2" rid="c44">Hatcher &amp; Lassiter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr98-2" rid="c98">Weinert, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">A second example within applied sport psychology is that the ISSP Managing Council&#8217;s position stand does not articulate critical thinking, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-4" rid="c32">Elman et al. (2005)</xref> termed &#8220;thinking like a psychologist&#8221; (p. 369). This competency essentially relates to the ability to approach problem solving from a psychological and scientific perspective. More specifically, critical thinking involves an individual engaging in reflective thinking about relevant evidence to draw a sound conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Bensley, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Bensley (2008)</xref> observed that this competency is needed by psychologists to draw accurate conclusions from research, determine which theory is most appropriate, make correct diagnoses of client symptoms, and determine the most effective intervention. In addition to critical thinking skills, it is worth noting that psychologists should also possess critical thinking dispositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">Halpern, 1998</xref>), such as open-mindedness, intellectual curiosity, commitment to reason, and a skeptical attitude.</p>
<p align="left">A third example within applied sport psychology relates to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr96-4" rid="c96">Ward et al.&#8217;s (2005)</xref> mention of effective relationships, which relates to the domain of relationships in the cube model and is defined as the &#8220;capacity to relate effectively and meaningfully with individuals, groups, and/or communities&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-4" rid="c69">Rodolfa et al., 2005</xref>, p. 351). Elements that merit particular attention include conceptualization of sets of operations or skills for relating effectively with others, developing one&#8217;s own professional approaches and persona, and internalizing professional standards. These qualities have been explored in diverse literatures spanning the working alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr60-1" rid="c60">Martin, Garske, &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>), transference (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1" rid="c47">H&#248;glend et al., 2008</xref>) and countertransference (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1" rid="c41">Gelso &amp; Hayes, 2007</xref>), the real relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">Gelso, 2011</xref>), psychological mindedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Farber &amp; Golden, 1997</xref>), and emotional intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Boyatzis, Goleman, &amp; Rhee, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">The cube model&#8217;s stages of development highlights the need for a hierarchical, linear structure to competency development in applied sport psychology such that the sequence of training and development is progressive in nature. This implication will be discussed in more detail in the next section on professional development and lifelong learning; however, before doing so, it is important to recognize that evidence of various personality characteristics, intellectual, and personal skills form a prerequisite to a student commencing training (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-3" rid="c44">Hatcher &amp; Lassiter, 2007</xref>). If an individual is deemed to be deficient in any of these areas at the outset of training, it would put the student&#8217;s fitness for the profession in question and possibly preclude him or her proceeding with training (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-2" rid="c7">Andersen et al., 2000</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-1" rid="c72">Sakinofsky (1979)</xref> observed, a trainee &#8220;&#8230; must already be a concerned, compassionate, intelligent, and sensitive human being before this training even begins. Training may mature and refine the experience of his [sic] concern and empathy, but it cannot supply what does not exist in the first place&#8221; (p. 195).</p>

<title>Professional Development and Lifelong Learning in Applied Sport Psychology</title>
<p align="left">Assuming an individual is able to demonstrate evidence of the prerequisite characteristics and skills, the student should commence professional training toward independent professional competence in psychology. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-5" rid="c32">Elman et al. (2005)</xref> defined professional development as &#8220;the developmental process of acquiring, expanding, refining, and sustaining knowledge, proficiency, skill, and qualifications for competent professional functioning that result in professionalism&#8221; (p. 368). It comprises intrapersonal aspects, such as clarifying professional objectives and identity, and interpersonal aspects, such as realizing professional autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-6" rid="c32">Elman et al., 2005</xref>). A major challenge facing most professions is developing and maintaining competence in the face of simultaneous increases in the specialization and profusion of knowledge. One indicator of this challenge is the shrinking &#8220;half-life&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Dubin, 1972</xref>) of professional knowledge in a field. The half-life of professional knowledge can be defined as the time it takes, in the absence of any new learning, to become roughly half as knowledgeable or competent as a function of the profusion of new knowledge in the field. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-1" rid="c63">Neimeyer, Taylor, and Rozensky (2012)</xref> recently argued that the half-life of knowledge in some areas of professional psychology is expected to shrink in the foreseeable future to as little as 3&#8722;4 years.</p>
<p align="left">Within the applied sport psychology literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr88-1" rid="c88">Tod and Lavallee (2011)</xref> recently remarked that current training and supervision practices might be insufficient for preparing students for applied sport psychology careers. They argued that the traditional focus on performance enhancement and psychological skills training, together with an underemphasis on process and relationship issues that affect service delivery, is inadequate to meet the needs of clients in contemporary sport. They concluded that much can be gained in the training and development of applied sport psychologists by integrating a variety of approaches from the field of general psychology. Indeed, from a broader professional development perspective, it has been noted that much remains to be learned about sport psychology maturation and how practitioners change throughout their careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr84-2" rid="c84">Tod, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr102-3" rid="c102">Wylleman et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">One of the important implications of the cube model is the need for a hierarchical, linear structure to competency development in applied sport psychology. Because professional development is a lifelong learning experience, it may relate to diverse tasks associated with starting graduate school (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Anderson &amp; Lavallee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Andersen, Williams, Aldridge, &amp; Taylor, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-4" rid="c11">Aoyagi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Burke, Sachs, Fry, &amp; Schweighardt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">Feltz, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">Holt &amp; Strean, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr71-1" rid="c71">Sachs &amp; Burke, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr86-1" rid="c86">Tod, Andersen, &amp; Marchant, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr93-1" rid="c93">Van Raalte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr100-1" rid="c100">Williams &amp; Scherzer, 2003</xref>), pursuing internships (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr80-1" rid="c80">Tammen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr91-1" rid="c91">Tonn &amp; Harmison, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr101-1" rid="c101">Woodcock, Richards, &amp; Mugford, 2008</xref>), completing professional degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr102-4" rid="c102">Wylleman et al., 2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Demers, Woodburn, &amp; Savard, 2006</xref>), pursuing postdoctoral activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1" rid="c46">Hays, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-1" rid="c49">Jackson, Taylor, &amp; Schuls, 2010</xref>), preparing for licensure (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-2" rid="c9">Anderson &amp; Lavallee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-1" rid="c58">Manley &amp; Meijen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr73-1" rid="c73">Sarkar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr86-2" rid="c86">Tod et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr90-1" rid="c90">Tod &amp; Thatcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr93-2" rid="c93">Van Raalte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr102-5" rid="c102">Wylleman et al., 2009</xref>), beginning a career (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-2" rid="c49">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr87-1" rid="c87">Tod, Andersen, &amp; Marchant, 2011</xref>), functioning during the midcareer years (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-3" rid="c9">Anderson &amp; Lavallee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-1" rid="c66">Poczwardowski &amp; Lauer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr83-1" rid="c83">Thatcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr102-6" rid="c102">Wylleman et al., 2009</xref>), or nearing retirement. What is evident from the training and development literature in applied sport psychology is that attention has typically focused on the early stages of education and tended to neglect licensed practitioners&#8217; lifelong learning.</p>
<p align="left">It is critical that applied sport psychology as a profession better recognizes the ongoing and dynamic nature of professional development tasks and activities. During training, these tasks may focus on the development of knowledge, skills, and proficiencies, whereas subsequent developmental activities may center on the refinement of these competencies or on specialization. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-2" rid="c46">Hays (2010)</xref> emphasized that interdisciplinary training should occur &#8220;so that the effective intersection of psychology and sport sciences can support the development of competent sport psychology practitioners&#8221; (p. 150). Later in practice, professional development tasks may refer to furthering skill development and attaining or updating of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr102-7" rid="c102">Wylleman et al., 2009</xref>) or to preventing the erosion of competencies as a part of lifelong learning. Professional development activities could also reflect efforts to expand, deepen, generalize, or redirect competencies and knowledge into expertise in areas beyond those encountered in formal education and training (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Gould, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Hays, 2006</xref>). Professional development tasks may be promoted in classrooms, workshops, or continuing professional education programs or through professional and personal experiences, such as reading, mentoring, and consultation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-5" rid="c11">Aoyagi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr83-2" rid="c83">Thatcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr97-1" rid="c97">Watson, Clement, Blom, &amp; Grindley, 2009</xref>). Finally, professional development may refer to external processes reflecting attainment of competence (e.g., licensure or board certification) or to ascending career ladders (e.g., assuming supervisory, administrative, or managerial functions, academic promotion).</p>
<p align="left">One of the main challenges for applied sport psychology is to address the lack of standardization relating to what constitutes professional development activities. Currently, professional development consists of an assortment of activities, roles, and responsibilities that have been described in the professional psychology literature as consisting of a patchwork of conceptually varied forms of learning stitched together by widely variable regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Adams &amp; Sharkin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Daniels &amp; Walter, 2002</xref>). To help better organize and understanding this range of activities, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-1" rid="c57">Lichtenberg and Goodyear (2012)</xref> distinguished between three forms of learning: formal learning involving a structured learning context with predetermined objectives (e.g., completing a professional degree); informal learning involving largely independent, self-directed activities (e.g., reading books or articles); and incidental learning involving development as byproduct of engaging in professional activity (e.g., presenting a professional workshop). A fourth type of learning, termed <italic>nonformal learning</italic>, has also been proposed involving development that occurs outside of recognized educational institutions (e.g., community education courses; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr99-1" rid="c99">Werquin, 2008</xref>). The training and development documentation in applied sport psychology needs to better distinguish between these types of learning and, importantly, better regulate trainees&#8217; and practitioners&#8217; engagement with the range of potential activities to stimulate professional development.</p>
<p align="left">According to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-7" rid="c32">Elman et al. (2005)</xref>, two important considerations in professional development relate to individual variation and contextual factors. Regarding the first issue, they recognized that variability in how individuals develop will likely affect the course and extent of their journey to competence. Because various innate or intangible capabilities&#8212;such as motivation and curiosity&#8212;have the potential to influence an individual&#8217;s receptivity to developmental-related experiences, attention should not focus solely on more formal training pathways. Indeed, echoing comments made in the applied sport psychology literature by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr81-5" rid="c81">Taylor (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr100-2" rid="c100">Williams and Scherzer (2003)</xref>, Elman et al. questioned whether a doctoral psychology education can instill in students the values and skills underlying professional development and competence, particularly for those students in whom deficits in such skills exist at entry to graduate school (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr92-1" rid="c92">Vacha-Haase, Davenport, &amp; Kerewsky, 2004</xref>). In terms of the regulatory and educational implications for applied sport psychology, trainees should be monitored for receptivity to developmental-related experiences, and practitioners should engage with reflective practice and peer supervision to invigorate their learning.</p>
<p align="left">Turning to the second issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-8" rid="c32">Elman et al. (2005)</xref> argued that the training and work environments, as contexts in which professional development occurs, also warrant attention. They noted that training environment and institutional culture have the potential to nurture or stifle individuals&#8217; personal and professional growth. Because individuals will vary in terms of their background, personality, preparation, and resilience to stress, an interaction effect may be presumed to operate among trainees, faculty, and training environments. Within the applied sport psychology literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr88-2" rid="c88">Tod and Lavallee (2011)</xref> recently argued that the focus on research in universities creates environments that hinder educators&#8217; attempts to assist students&#8217; development. Hence, supervisors and institutions need to conduct regular reviews and audits of their respective characteristics and systems, and address any issues that impede the professional development of trainees.</p>
<p align="left">It is hoped and expected that as trainees and professionals move through professional development activities and benchmarks, there will be, at a practical and day-to-day level, a simultaneous internal development of professionalism as a desired outcome of their professional development efforts. In this sense, practitioners will crystallize their professional identity, establishing their identity as a psychologist (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-2" rid="c39">Friedman &amp; Kaslow, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr94-1" rid="c94">VanZandt, 1990</xref>), internalizing standards of the field (e.g., ethics and standards of practice), undergoing introjections of and socialization into a professional role, and refining interpersonal and self-reflective skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-1" rid="c74">Sch&#246;n, 1983</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-2" rid="c25">Cropley et al. (2010)</xref> recently highlighted the value of regular reflective practice in applied sport psychology. They suggested that approaches to reflective practice, such as technical rationality, knowing-in-action, reflection-in-action, and reflection-on-action, should be integrated into psychologists&#8217; professional training and development.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p align="left">In this article, we have defined competence with a view to better understanding its role in applied sport psychology, delineated competencies involving the critique of training and development documentation, introduced a competency model and discussed its implications for applied sport psychology, and explored issues relating to professional development and lifelong learning within the field. One of the main overarching messages to emerge is that current training and development documentation are inadequate in terms of preparing trainees in all the necessary competencies for applied sport psychology. To address this limitation, we propose that developments in professional psychology can provide a more robust foundation for professional development and lifelong learning in the field. Having reviewed and critiqued related literature, our hope is that article will initiate an ongoing dialogue that will result in a paradigm shift toward a competency-based understanding of applied sport psychology. The challenge for the field is to create and sustain a culture of competence throughout the training and development of its practitioners. It is hoped that such a movement will enable the profession to become more accountable (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr76-2" rid="c76">Smith, 1989</xref>), thus enhancing its communication with stakeholders and public about the services it can provide.</p>
<p align="left">Taking the lead from the 2002 Competencies Conference: Future Directions in Education and Credentialing in Professional Psychology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-2" rid="c51">Kaslow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-3" rid="c52">Kaslow et al., 2004</xref>), it is recommended that an international conference specifically focused on this topic be convened between the major organizations and stakeholders in applied sport psychology. A steering committee should be formed consisting of individuals representing a range of education, training, credentialing, and practice constituencies, reflecting diversity in work settings and locations, professional roles and responsibilities, and areas of competence. In terms of preparing for such a conference, an online preconference survey, marketing to a wide range of delegates from both within and without the field of applied sport psychology, and preconference reading are some approaches that might optimize the delivery of the conference itself (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-4" rid="c52">Kaslow et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">If this vision of a conference is realized, workgroups will likely need to be formed around the foundational or core competencies in applied sport psychology. We anticipate that these workgroups will need to focus their attention on two main areas of competence: identification and training. An urgent requirement is to more clearly identify and benchmark the competencies for applied sport psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr102-8" rid="c102">Wylleman et al., 2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-3" rid="c46">Hays, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr82-5" rid="c82">Tenenbaum et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr96-5" rid="c96">Ward et al., 2005</xref>), involving the development of a framework that delineates each competency&#8217;s essential component and behavioral anchor. Equally important is the identification of the crosscutting competencies relevant to all aspects of competence and to all levels of an applied sport psychologist&#8217;s professional development. Turning to training, greater attention needs to be paid to informed education and training across an applied sport psychologist&#8217;s life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr84-3" rid="c84">Tod, 2007</xref>), with a particular emphasis on articulating the tasks and activities that occur throughout the different phases of a practitioner&#8217;s career. A developmentally appropriate and progressive training pathway that outlines more specific methods for teaching competencies and their subcompetencies should be developed. Two related areas worthy of consideration at such a conference are the assessment of competence in trainees and practitioners, and how to address and remediate professional competence problems. We believe that each workgroup should be encouraged to contribute a paper to a special issue of an international peer-reviewed journal on the topic of professional competence in applied sport psychology. Such an issue would provide a much needed stimulus to foster a culture of competence in applied sport psychology.</p>
<p align="left">Although a shift in applied sport psychology to a culture of competence would be a challenging endeavor, it is one that is required in view of the need to develop the credibility of the profession. We believe that the challenges this will bring are best not viewed as insurmountable barriers, but rather as a modern pilgrimage toward the maturation of applied sport psychology. Meeting these challenges would involve systematic change and stakeholders working in collaboration toward shared solutions. As this culture becomes more routine and institutionalized, and as more cohorts of practitioners accept and embrace competence as a fundamental part of their everyday practices, the field of applied sport psychology will have a more positive and far-reaching impact on athletes&#8217; lives, well-being, and performance.</p>
