<p align="left">Prospective, population-based studies have consistently indicated a bidirectional relationship between depression and Type 2 diabetes. A recent meta-analysis reported that depression is associated with approximately 60% elevated risk of incident Type 2 diabetes, and that Type 2 diabetes is only associated with a modest elevation in risk of new depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Mezuk, Eaton, Albrecht, &amp; Golden, 2008</xref>). More recent examinations have reported that Type 2 diabetes is associated with approximately 30% increased risk of developing depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Golden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">Pan et al., 2010</xref>). Among those with established Type 2 diabetes, depression is associated with poorer disease management, inadequate glycemic control, and risk of diabetes complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">de Groot, Anderson, Freedland, Clouse &amp; Lustman, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">There is evidence that the association between diabetes and risk of depression is strongest among those using more intense methods of diabetes control (e.g., insulin as opposed to oral medications) (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-2" rid="c14">Golden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-2" rid="c39">Pan et al., 2010</xref>). In a longitudinal study <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-3" rid="c14">Golden and colleagues (2008)</xref> reported that while diagnosed Type 2 diabetes was predictive of elevated depressive symptoms, undiagnosed diabetes was not related to higher levels of depressive symptomology and was potentially associated with lower risk of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-4" rid="c14">Golden et al., 2008</xref>). This finding&#8212;combined with evidence that more intense diabetes management may be associated with greater risk of depression&#8212;have led some to ask whether &#8220;ignorance is bliss&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">Golden &amp; Mezuk, 2009</xref>). That is, is receiving a diagnosis of diabetes and the accompanying clinical recommendations to substantially change lifestyle (i.e., diet, exercise, alcohol use), rather than the state of chronic hyperglycemia, the &#8220;depressogenic&#8221; element in this comorbidity. A recent meta-analysis found that the prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms among persons with undiagnosed diabetes or prediabetes is lower than the prevalence among those with diagnosed diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Nouwen et al., 2011</xref>), although the majority of these studies did not account for key confounders (e.g., race/ethnicity, health behaviors, comorbidity), which previous reports have demonstrated can substantially influence this association (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">M&#228;ntyselk&#228; et al., 2011</xref>). This limitation is important because recent evidence from epidemiologic studies has indicated that in the context of high levels of stress, engaging in poor health behaviors (i.e., alcohol use, smoking, poor diet) is associated with lower risk of depression for some groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Jackson, Rafferty, &amp; Knight, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">Mezuk et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that efforts to modify health behaviors in stressful, socially disadvantaged contexts without feasible alternative coping behaviors may have the perverse consequence of increasing risk of depression.</p>
<p align="left">Parallel to this evidence of diabetes subsequent to depression, several recent studies have suggested a link between antidepressant medication use and risk of Type 2 diabetes. However, the degree to which this association reflects confounding by indication is unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-3" rid="c39">Pan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Kivim&#228;ki et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">Rubin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1" rid="c44">Rubin et al., 2010</xref>; Pan et al., 2011). It has been argued that the weight gain associated with some antidepressants may be a mediating mechanism linking depression and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Kivim&#228;ki et al., 2010b</xref>), but randomized controlled studies have demonstrated that antidepressant use is associated with improved glycemic control among patients with both depression and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Lustman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Lustman et al., 2006</xref>). It is also possible that persons with clinically identified diabetes have more contact with health care providers as part of disease management, and this may increase the likelihood that depressive symptoms are identified by a clinician and treated with antidepressant medications; this process would introduce a spurious association between diabetes and antidepressant use through clinical ascertainment bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Berkson, 1946</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">The relationship between depression and Type 2 diabetes has implications for diabetes prevention and treatment practice. For example, if some diabetes care regimens are &#8220;depressogenic&#8221; in nature, this suggests that health care providers need to both routinely screen for depression among patients and integrate effective coping and problem-solving strategies into diabetes case counseling to reduce risk of subsequent depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Katon et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, if both depression and antidepressant medication use are associated with risk of diabetes, this indicates that providers need to focus on nonpharmacologic depression treatment strategies, particularly for patients with elevated diabetes risk (e.g., patients with a positive family history of diabetes, gestational diabetes, or overweight) (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-2" rid="c44">Rubin et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between current depressive symptoms and antidepressant medication use with clinically identified and undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes. The secondary aim was to examine the associations of health behaviors and diabetes care regimens to depressive symptomology. If the association between Type 2 diabetes and depression arises as a result of the behavioral changes and associated psychological stress that result from receiving a diagnosis of diabetes, rather than through biological pathways via hyperglycemia, we expect that clinically identified diabetes, but not undiagnosed diabetes, will be associated with depressive symptomology. Similarly, if the association between Type 2 diabetes and antidepressant medications arises as a result of ascertainment bias through increased connection with the health care system or as a result of treating diabetes care-related distress, we expect that only clinically identified diabetes will be associated with antidepressant medication use.</p>
<p align="left">Two main hypotheses were evaluated:
<statement content-type="hypothesis">
<p align="left"><italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> Clinically identified, but not undiagnosed, diabetes is associated with elevated depressive symptoms</p></statement>
<statement content-type="hypothesis">
<p align="left"><italic>Hypothesis 2:</italic> Clinically identified, but not undiagnosed, diabetes is associated with greater use of antidepressant medications.</p></statement>
</p>
<p align="left">Finally, this study also examined whether the association between clinically identified diabetes and depression is partly attributable to the behavioral changes required to manage this condition. Specifically, we were interested in whether the relationship between diabetes and depression varies as a function of engaging in poor health behaviors (e.g., smoking, high-fat diet, excessive alcohol intake), health promotion behaviors (e.g., eating a low calorie diet, increasing physical activity), and diabetes care regimens (e.g., insulin and use of other medications).</p>

<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p align="left">Data are from the 2005 and 2007 cross-sections of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Centers for Disease Control, 2004</xref>). Analysis were limited to non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic adults aged 30 or older (<italic>M</italic><sub location="post">age</sub> = 52.08, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.49) who provided blood samples for assessment of fasting plasma glucose as part of the Mobile Examination Center (MEC) component of the NHANES interview (1,501 in 2005 and 1,940 in 2007, for a total of 3,441 participants). After excluding participants with incomplete data on the Patient Health Questionniare-9 (PHQ-9) (<italic>n</italic> = 186), and those with clinically identified diabetes who reported an age of onset younger than age 30 or for whom age of onset was missing (<italic>n</italic> = 72), the final analytic sample size was 3,183. The two waves were combined for analysis, and weights were used to account for the stratified multistage probability sampling approach. Those excluded for missing data on the PHQ-9 (<italic>n</italic> = 186) were less likely to be non-Hispanic White (77.5% in the retained sample vs. 65.4% in the excluded sample, chi-square test of independence &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(2, <italic>n</italic> = 3369) = 9.13, <italic>p</italic> = .01, &#981;<sub location="post">c</sub> = .04). The age of those excluded from analysis (<italic>M</italic> = 52.61, <italic>SE</italic> = 1.54) did not significantly differ from those included (<italic>M</italic> = 52.08, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.49), <italic>t</italic>(3369) = &#8722;.34, <italic>p</italic> = .740. Chi-square tests of independence indicated that those excluded from analysis also did not differ in terms of diabetes status, &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(4, <italic>n</italic> = 3369) = 7.43, <italic>p</italic> = .11, <italic>ns</italic>, education, &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(1, <italic>n</italic> = 3369) = 1.67, <italic>p</italic> = .20, &#981; = .02, <italic>ns</italic>, poverty-to-income ratio, &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(1, <italic>n</italic> = 3369) = 2.46, <italic>p</italic> = .12, &#981; = .03, <italic>ns</italic>, or antidepressant medication use, &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(1, <italic>n</italic> = 3369) = 1.92, <italic>p</italic> = .17, &#981; = .02, <italic>ns</italic>.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="s5" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Type 2 diabetes</title>
<p align="left">Type 2 diabetes status (normoglycemia, prediabetes, and diabetes) was defined according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines using fasting (for at least 8 hours) plasma glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">American Diabetes Association, 2010</xref>). Participants were asked if they had ever been told by a physician that they had diabetes or high sugar, and their current medications were recorded. Diabetes and prediabetes were considered <italic>clinically identified</italic> if participants reported either that a physician had told them they had diabetes (indicated by a positive response to the question, &#8220;[Other than during pregnancy] Have you ever been told by a doctor or health professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?&#8221; for diabetes and &#8220;Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you have any of the following: prediabetes, impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, borderline diabetes or that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes or sugar diabetes?&#8221;). Persons currently using hypoglycemic agents were classified as having clinically identified diabetes, not prediabetes, regardless of their response to these self-report items. Normoglycemia was defined as fasting plasma glucose &lt;100 mg/dL and no use of hypoglycemic agents or physician diagnosis. Undiagnosed prediabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose between 100 and 125.9 mg/dL and no report of physician diagnosis. Clinically identified prediabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose between 100 and 125.9 mg/dL plus report of physician diagnosis. Undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose &gt;126 mg/dL and no report of physician diagnosis. Clinically identified Type 2 diabetes was defined as plasma glucose &gt;126 mg/dL plus report of physician diagnosis or use of hypoglycemic agents.</p>

<sec id="s6" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Depression syndrome</title>
<p align="left">Depression syndrome was assessed using the Patient Health Questionniare-9 (PHQ-9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">Kroenke, Spitzer &amp; Williams, 2001</xref>). Individuals were categorized as likely being a case of major depression syndrome if they endorsed either dysphoria or anhedonia, plus four or more remaining items &#8220;more than half the days&#8221; in the past two weeks. Individuals were categorized as likely being a case of minor depression if they endorsed either dysphoria or anhedonia, and at least two, but less than four, of the remaining symptoms for at least &#8220;more than half the days.&#8221; For both minor and major depression syndrome the item on suicidal ideation was counted if it was endorsed regardless of duration, consistent with the PHQ-9 diagnostic algorithm. The reliability and validity of the PHQ-9 has been assessed both in the general population and in clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, Lowe, 2010</xref>), and this measure has moderate concordance with clinical diagnosis of major depressive disorder (Kappa ranging from 0.50&#8211;0.69) (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Eaton, Hall, MacDonald &amp; McKibben, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Medication use</title>
<p align="left">Current prescription drug use was assessed by visual inspection of medication bottles by interviewers. Medications were classified using Lexicon Plus, a comprehensive database of all prescription and some nonprescription drug products available in the United States. Insulin or other medications with indications as antidiabetic agents (e.g., metformin) were categorized as diabetic medications, and any individual who reported taking these agents were categorized as having diagnosed Type 2 diabetes, as described above. Current use of all classes of antidepressant medications (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRI], monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOI], or tricyclic antidepressants [TCA]) was collapsed into a single variable indicating antidepressant use. The majority (61%) of antidepressant agents used were SSRIs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Poor health behaviors</title>
<p align="left">Three types of poor health behaviors were assessed: smoking, excessive alcohol use, and poor eating habits. Cigarette smoking was dichotomized as current versus former/never smoker. Heavy alcohol consumption was defined as both being a current drinker and having an average of more than two drinks on days when alcohol was consumed (nondrinkers and those consuming two drinks or fewer were the reference group). Two proxy indicators of eating habits were derived from body mass index (BMI) and a 24-hr dietary recall. BMI was calculated from measured weight and height while wearing light clothing and dichotomized as obese (&#8805;30 kg/m<sup location="post">2</sup>) versus not obese (BMI &lt;30 kg/m<sup location="post">2</sup>). Based on previous studies of diet and stress coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Dallman et al., 2003</xref>), poor diet was defined as having low adherence to recommended levels of total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, and cholesterol consumption, based on the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1" rid="c47">USDA, 2005</xref>). The measure of dietary adherence was created by assessing the number met of a possible four USDA guidelines using a single 24-hr dietary recall questionnaire. On average, participants endorsed one of the USDA recommended levels, and as a result having a poor diet was defined as being below the sample mean (e.g., meeting less than one dietary guideline). These four poor health behaviors were summed to create a count with scores ranging from 0 to 4 (<italic>M</italic> = 1.05, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.03), which was recategorized for analysis (range: 0&#8211;3+, <italic>M</italic> = 1.05, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.03) because of small cell sizes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Health promotion behaviors</title>
<p align="left">Three types of health promotion behaviors were assessed: increasing physical activity, controlling weight, and managing diet. Participants were asked both whether they had been <italic>told</italic> by a physician to engage in these behaviors, and whether they were <italic>trying</italic> to engage in the behaviors. A count of the number of physician recommendations was created by summing these behaviors (range: 0&#8211;3, <italic>M</italic> = 0.93, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.03). A second count of the number of positive health behaviors the respondent was attempting was also created (range: 0&#8211;3, <italic>M</italic> = 1.58, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04). Respondents with clinically identified diabetes were also asked the number of times in an average day they check their blood sugar (range: 0&#8211;6, <italic>M</italic> = 1.30, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.06).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s10" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Demographic variables and other covariates</title>
<p align="left">Demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education) were assessed by self-report. Race/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, or Hispanic. Education was measured in years, and dichotomized as high school completion or less versus more than high school. Household poverty-to-income ratio (PIR), a measure of a family's poverty threshold accounting for family size and composition, was used to index socioeconomic status; poverty status was defined as a PIR &#8804;1.85, based on the eligibility cutpoint for USDA food assistance programs (supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children; food stamps; etc.). Health insurance was dichotomized as yes if participants reported having health insurance or being covered by a health care plan, including Medicaid or Medicare. Number of health care visits in the past year, categorized as none, one, 2 to 3, 4 to 9, 10 to 12, and 13 or more, was also assessed. The presence of three medical comorbidities common among diabetes patients, kidney disease, hypertension, and heart disease, which included congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, or angina, was indexed by summing the number of conditions present (range: 0&#8211;3). Presence of each condition was based on self-report of physician diagnosis for kidney disease and heart disease, and self-report of physician diagnosis, antihypertension medication use, or elevated blood pressure (average systolic blood pressure &#8805;140 mm|Hg or diastolic blood pressure &#8805;90 mm|Hg) for hypertension.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p align="left">Initial comparisons of covariates by diabetes status were assessed using chi-squared tests for categorical variables and <italic>F</italic> tests for continuous variables. To address the first hypothesis, logistic regression was used to test the association between Type 2 diabetes status (e.g., normoglycemic, undiagnosed, clinically identified) as the independent variable and major depression syndrome as the dependent variable. Four nested regression models were fit: unadjusted, adjusted for demographic characteristics, additional adjustment for poor health behaviors, and additional adjustment for adherence to health promotion behaviors and health insurance. To address the second hypothesis, logistic regression was used to assess the association between diabetes status as the independent variable and antidepressant medication use as the dependent variable. For both the depression and antidepressant analyses, the reference group of the primary independent variable was always normoglycemia (that is, the odds ratios reflect the expected difference between diagnosed diabetes/prediabetes vs. normoglycemia, and undiagnosed diabetes/prediabetes vs. normoglycemia). Finally, analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between health behaviors, diabetes care regimens, and depression syndrome. To address whether the relationship between poor health behaviors, health promotion behaviors, and likelihood of depression varied by clinical characteristics of Type 2 diabetes, models were stratified by diabetes status. Among those with clinically identified diabetes, the influence of diabetes care regimens on likelihood of depression was also assessed.</p>
<p align="left">A series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of these results. Models were refit excluding participants with prediabetes (undiagnosed and clinically identified). Proportional odds models were fit using a three-level measure of depression syndrome (major, minor, and none) as the outcome. Models were also fit with additional adjustment for medical comorbidities to account for potential diabetes-related complications. Finally, models were fit using the individual health behaviors rather than counts. The results of these analyses were consistent with those presented here, indicating that the findings are robust to these variations in model specification. Survey weights were used in all analyses to account for the sampling design, and as a result all descriptive statistics report standard errors rather than standard deviations. NHANES is approved by the National Center for Health Statistics Research Ethics Review Board and all participants provided informed consent. All analyses were conducted using SAS (v9.2) and all <italic>p</italic> values refer to two-tailed tests.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p align="left">As shown by <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-1" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, 8.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 419) of the sample had clinically identified Type 2 diabetes, 3.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 126) had clinically identified prediabetes, 3.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 131) had undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes, 38.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 1,213) had undiagnosed prediabetes, and the remaining 45.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 1,294) were normoglycemic. Among those with clinically identified Type 2 diabetes, the average age of onset was 51.6 years (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.8 years). Consistent with previous research, persons with Type 2 diabetes were older, more likely to be Black or Hispanic, and of lower socioeconomic status. Persons with clinically identified diabetes were most likely to report being told by their physician to engage in positive health behaviors and report attempting those behaviors. The mean fasting plasma glucose levels of undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes and clinically identified Type 2 diabetes were identical (153.5 mg/dL), but there was more variability in this measure among the undiagnosed group. As expected, the clinically identified Type 2 diabetes group reported greater frequency of health care visits in the past year (an average of 4&#8211;9 visits) than the other groups (which each reported an average of 2&#8211;3 visits).<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl1"/></p>
<p align="left">As shown by <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-1" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, clinically identified Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes were significantly associated with major depression syndrome even after accounting for health behaviors (Odds ratio [OR] = 4.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.00&#8211;9.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). As hypothesized, undiagnosed diabetes was not associated with depression syndrome in either crude (OR = 1.06; 95% CI [0.59&#8211;1.89], <italic>p</italic> = .850) or adjusted (OR = 1.35; 95% CI [0.70&#8211;2.59], <italic>p</italic> = .375) analyses. When the prediabetes cases were excluded from the analysis, the association between undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes and depression was still not statistically significant (adjusted OR = 2.65, 95% CI [0.75&#8211;9.33], <italic>p</italic> = .130), but the point estimate was more similar to that for clinically identified diabetes (adjusted OR = 3.21, 95% CI [1.42&#8211;7.22], <italic>p</italic> = .005) (Supplemental <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-2" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Analyses with a three-level indicator of depressive symptom severity (e.g., major, minor, and no depression) using proportional odds regression were consistent with these findings, indicating a much stronger relationship between diagnosed diabetes and higher depressive symptoms (adjusted OR = 2.57, 95% CI [1.72&#8211;3.84], <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) than between undiagnosed diabetes and depressive symptoms (adjusted OR = 1.51, 95% CI [1.03&#8211;2.21], <italic>p</italic> = .034). As shown by <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc3-1" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, clinically identified Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes were significantly associated with antidepressant use (OR = 1.75; 95% CI [1.20&#8211;2.54], <italic>p</italic> = .004). As hypothesized, undiagnosed diabetes was not associated with antidepressant use in either crude (OR = 0.78; 95% CI [0.59&#8211;1.04], <italic>p</italic> = .094) or adjusted analyses (OR = 0.86; 95% CI [0.66&#8211;1.13], <italic>p</italic> = .278).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p align="left">The primary finding of this study is that clinically identified diabetes is associated with depression syndrome, whereas undiagnosed diabetes is not. This relationship was most evident among the prediabetes cases. Similarly, clinically identified, but not undiagnosed, diabetes is associated with antidepressant medication use. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that formal clinical diagnosis of diabetes is predictive of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-2" rid="c38">Nouwen et al., 2011</xref>). A recent study on hypertension reported parallel findings; that is, clinically identified, but not undiagnosed, hypertension was associated with elevated psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Hamer, Batty, Stamatakis, &amp; Kivimaki, 2010</xref>). Together, these findings support the hypothesis that factors related to the clinical identification and self-management of diabetes, rather than a state of chronic hyperglycemia in and of itself, underlies the risk of depression (and treatment of depression with pharmacologic agents) associated with Type 2 diabetes. However, these findings do not preclude the possibility that other biological mechanisms not examined here (e.g., inflammation, sympathetic nervous system activation) contribute to the relationship between diabetes and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Champaneri, Wand, Malhotra, Casagrande &amp; Golden, 2010</xref>). It is also important to note that subsequent sensitivity analyses demonstrated a positive but nonsignificant association of undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes with depression syndrome.</p>
<p align="left">These findings raise two overarching clinical questions: What is inherently distressing about receiving a diagnosis of diabetes, and does this distress contribute to patient nonadherence to diabetes care regimens? Diabetes care is generally characterized by problem-focused coping, in which a person changes their behavior and learns new skills to manage the stressor, in this case diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Macrodimitris &amp; Endler, 2001</xref>). The development and prognosis of Type 2 diabetes is influenced by both uncontrollable (e.g., genetic liability) and controllable (e.g., health behaviors) factors; therefore, exclusively using a problem-focused approach may not be an effective coping strategy. The process of repeatedly &#8220;failing&#8221; to control this stressor (i.e., achieving adequate glycemic control, adhering to behavioral changes) may affect self-esteem and sense of mastery or induce a sense of learned helplessness, subsequently increasing risk of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">Duangdao &amp; Roesch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Bennett &amp; Elliot, 2005</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, research suggests that maintaining a sense of perceived control over Type 2 diabetes is negatively correlated with developing depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-2" rid="c32">Macrodimitris &amp; Endler, 2001</xref>). Similarly, a recent qualitative study identified multiple stressors associated with diabetes diagnosis that influence ability to engage in self-care (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1" rid="c41">Penckofer, Ferrans, Velsor-Friedrich, &amp; Savoy, 2007</xref>). For instance, patients found it difficult to adjust their lives to comply with new meal plans and medication protocols to keep their blood sugar under control, which created additional time pressure in their lives and limited their ability to travel and make plans. To deal with this psychosocial stress, patients reported sometimes engaging in behaviors such as eating high fat and sugar foods, which they referred to as &#8220;taking a diabetes break&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-2" rid="c41">Penckofer, Ferrans, Velsor-Friedrich, &amp; Savoy, 2007</xref>, p. 686)</p>
<p align="left">The null findings regarding antidepressant medication use and Type 2 diabetes risk confirm those of a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Kivim&#228;ki et al., 2011</xref>) and contrast with those reported by Rubin and colleagues in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-2" rid="c43">Rubin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-3" rid="c44">Rubin et al., 2010</xref>). The DPP required a high degree of participant involvement (e.g., clinical ascertainment every 6 months, interviews every 3 months) (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">Diabetes Prevention Program, 1999</xref>), and it is conceivable that involvement in the trial may have influenced attitudes about health care use in general (e.g., participants may have become more willing to discuss depressive symptoms with their physician). Indeed, Rubin and colleagues have previously reported that the use of antidepressants among DPP participants marginally increased over the follow-up period, although they report that this increase paralleled increases in the general population over that same period (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Rubin et al., 2005</xref>). If participants with mild or moderate depressive symptoms, which have also been associated with diabetes risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Campayo et al., 2010</xref>), were more likely to either seek clinical care or otherwise come to the attention of a clinician to address psychological distress, this would produce a spurious association between antidepressant use and Type 2 diabetes; specifically, that antidepressant use predicts onset of Type 2 diabetes, even after controlling for more severe depressive symptomology due to residual confounding by indication (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-2" rid="c25">Kivim&#228;ki et al., 2010a</xref>). Randomized controlled trials of antidepressant use among patients with both Type 2 diabetes and depression have shown that these medications are associated with improvements in glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-2" rid="c31">Lustman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-2" rid="c30">Lustman et al., 2006</xref>) rather than worsening prognosis of diabetes. Together, these findings indicate that antidepressant medications in and of themselves do not increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes, and should remain a component of effective management of depression among patients with Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p align="left">In this study health behaviors were not consistently associated with depression syndrome. Among those with diagnosed diabetes the point estimates indicated that engaging in more health promotion behaviors was associated with lower likelihood of depression, although these estimates were not always statistically significant. Poor health behaviors were not significantly associated with depression syndrome after accounting for diabetes status; this finding is unexpected given the correlation between behavioral disorders such as nicotine and alcohol dependence and psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">John, Meyer, Rumpf &amp; Hapke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Hasin, Stinson, Ogburn &amp; Grant, 2007</xref>). However, the robustness of the associations between less severe depressive symptomology and more normative health behaviors such as adhering to a healthy diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Meier, Berchtold, Akre, Michaud &amp; Suris, 2010</xref>), regular smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">Benjet, Wagner, Borges, &amp; Medina-Mora, 2004</xref>), alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Golding, Burnam, Wells &amp; Benjamin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Goodman &amp; Huang, 2002</xref>), and overall (as opposed to visceral) obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2007</xref>) are less clear and vary by characteristics such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity. There was also no evidence that type of diabetes care-regimen was associated with depression syndrome, in contrast with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-4" rid="c39">Pan et al., 2010</xref>); one reason for this difference may be the lack of information on duration of diabetes care regimen.</p>

<title>Implications for Clinical Care</title>
<p align="left">The results of this study have implications for clinical care. The Collaborative Care Model (CCM), in which nonphysician personnel enhance patient self-care with diabetes education, encouragement to engage in enjoyable physical activities, goal setting, and problem-solving skills through regular contact with patients, has demonstrated effectiveness in improving clinical outcomes for patients with depression and Type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-2" rid="c23">Katon et al., 2010</xref>). This model is successful, at least partially, because it is focused on open communication between patients and health care providers about health goals and it provides a social resource (in the form of a care manager) to help patients achieve those goals. Other approaches to behavior change in health care settings, such as motivational interviewing and brief counseling sessions in primary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1" rid="c46">Spanou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Smith, Heckemeyer, Kratt, &amp; Mason, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">West, Gore, DiLillo, Greene &amp; Bursac, 2007</xref>), as well as incorporation of patient care decision aids (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Breslin, Millan, Montori, 2008</xref>), may also be helpful for patients with diabetes.</p>

<sec id="s15" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p align="left">These findings should be interpreted in light of study limitations. This is a cross-sectional study, and thus the direction of the relationship between depression syndrome and Type 2 diabetes cannot be inferred. Depression syndrome was determined using the PHQ-9, a self-report instrument that has moderate concordance with clinical diagnosis, but may have missed less severe cases of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-2" rid="c29">Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001</xref>). However, the findings from the sensitivity analysis examining major and minor depression were similar, suggesting this possible misclassification did not substantially influence the results. Health behaviors, including diabetes care regimens, were assessed by self-report and may be subject to reporting bias. Although the fasting plasma glucose levels of those with clinically identified and undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes were similar, without additional clinical data we cannot exclude the possibility that the clinically identified cases were more severe in other ways than the undiagnosed cases (e.g., longer duration, earlier age of onset); thus, it is possible that main predictor of depression risk was diabetes severity rather than factors related to disease management or behavior change. Future studies should explicitly test this hypothesis using a prospective design. However, the findings persisted after additional adjustment for medical comorbidities, suggesting that that this limitation did not substantially influence the findings. Also, while BMI is influenced by diet and physical activity, it is not a direct measure of food intake or other health behaviors. Finally, although only cases of clinically identified diabetes among adults aged 30 and older were included in the analysis, without further information it cannot be determined that all the diabetes cases examined here were definitively Type 2 rather than Type 1 diabetes. However, the average age of diabetes cases in the sample was approximately 50 years, and more than 90% of diabetes cases in the general adult population are Type 2.</p>
<p align="left">This study also has a number of strengths. The large, population-based sample reduces the risk of selection bias. Also, clinically identified and undiagnosed prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes were assessed using fasting plasma glucose samples in accordance with ADA standards. Medication use was assessed by direct inspection of pill bottles and categorized according to a national database, which mitigates the risk of underreporting of medication use and misclassification of medications. This study also accounted for key confounders, including socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and health behaviors, that many previous reports did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-3" rid="c38">Nouwen et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Additional prospective studies are needed to identify the causal mechanisms that contribute to comorbid depression and Type 2 diabetes, particularly concerning the mediating processes linking diabetes diagnosis, depression, health behaviors and treatment regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Markowitz, Gonzalez, Wilkinson, &amp; Safren, 2011</xref>). Studies that investigate both severe and subsyndromal depressive symptomology among individuals at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes may be particularly informative (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Holt et al., 2009</xref>). Longitudinal studies are also needed to better understand the relationship between health behavior change and depression in the context of diabetes.</p>
