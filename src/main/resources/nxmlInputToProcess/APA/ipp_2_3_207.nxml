<p align="left">This article describes structural characteristics and caregiver&#8211;child interactions (<italic>N</italic> = 34) in three Central American institutions for infants and young children (<italic>N</italic> = 79) and relates differences in these characteristics to differences in children&#8217;s physical, behavioral, and cognitive development. Generally, the institution with the smallest group size, fewest children per caregiver, and a few consistent caregivers had children with the best physical, behavioral, and cognitive development; this institution also had many temporary volunteers who played with the children. Differences in the quality of caregiver&#8211;child interactions were not directly related to children&#8217;s development, but the potential benefit of high-quality interactions may have been minimized by a high children:caregiver ratio in one institution, and the presence of volunteers to play with children may have compensated for and/or minimized the display of higher-quality interactions by staff caregivers in another institution.</p>

<sec id="s1">
<p align="left">One of the most fundamental questions in developmental science is the nature and extent of the contribution of early experiences to contemporary and long-term human development. Recently, institutionalized infants and young children have received considerable study, especially those who subsequently are adopted or enter foster care, because most institutions reported in the literature provide substandard care and therefore represent deficient early environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Rosas &amp; McCall, in press</xref>). Children in those institutions are typically housed in relatively large groups (9&#8211;16 children but up to 70) with high children:caregiver ratios (8:1&#8211;31:1). They may experience many and changing caregivers and graduate to new peers and caregivers when they attain developmental milestones (e.g., crawling, walking, 24 months). Moreover, caregivers often behave in a business-like perfunctory way with children and do not provide much warm, sensitive, and contingently responsive caregiver&#8211;child interactions.</p>
<p align="left">Not surprisingly, meta-analyses indicate institutionalized children are, on average, &gt;1 standard deviation (SD) below noninstitutionalized parent-reared children in both general physical and behavioral/cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1" rid="c54">Van IJzendoorn, Bakermans-Kranenburg, &amp; Juffer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-1" rid="c56">van IJzendoorn, Juffer, Poelhuis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-1" rid="c57">Van IJzendoorn, Luijk, &amp; Juffer, 2008</xref>), although some recent studies report more severe delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Groark, McCall, Fish, and the Whole Child International Evaluation Team, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-1" rid="c52">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A. Orphanage Research Team, 2005</xref>). The literature is also consistent in showing immediate and substantial catch-up in physical and cognitive development after children are removed from the institutions and placed in adoptive or foster families (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Fox, Almas, Degnan, Nelson, &amp; Zeanah, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-1" rid="c55">van IJzendoorn &amp; Juffer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-2" rid="c56">van IJzendoorn et al., 2005</xref>). But adopted postinstitutionalized (PI) children exposed to institutions for at least the first year or two of life (shorter if the institution is more severely depriving) display higher rates of a variety of long-term deficiencies and problems than non-PI children (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Juffer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">McCall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-1" rid="c58">Van IJzendoorn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr60-1" rid="c60">Zeanah, Gunnar, McCall, Kreppner, &amp; Fox, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">However, the literature on PI adopted children&#8217;s development is much more voluminous than the literature on the nature of the institutions from which they come or details of children&#8217;s development while residents. Thus, the field has much more information on the outcome variable of PI children&#8217;s contemporary and long-term development than on the nature of the early institutional experience. The result is that early institutionalization is treated, at least by default, as a uniform and an undifferentiated experience of varying lengths of time, despite the fact that institutions vary substantially between and within countries as well as over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-2" rid="c45">Rosas &amp; McCall, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">Selman, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">In addition to the lack of empirical data describing the possible relations between differences in institutions and differences in children&#8217;s development, there is little theory specifying the aspects of the institutional experience that likely produce the observed outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-2" rid="c33">McCall, 2011</xref>). Historically, blame was laid on a &#8220;lack of mothering,&#8221; which became refined by attachment theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Bakermans-Kranenburg et al., 2011</xref>) to an emphasis on the lack of sensitive and responsive care by a few consistent adults. But such care also provides a great deal of basic stimulation and reduced chronic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Gunnar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-3" rid="c33">McCall, 2011</xref>). These factors cannot easily be teased apart.</p>
<p align="left">Nevertheless, the preponderance of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-4" rid="c33">McCall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1" rid="c46">Rutter et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1" rid="c47">2010</xref>) converges on the potential contribution of generally inadequate caregiver&#8211;child interactions to institutionalized children&#8217;s contemporary and long-term development. For example, a few studies within institutions have described correlations between indices of caregiver&#8211;child interaction quality and children&#8217;s cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Dobrova-Krol, Van IJzendoorn, Bakermans-Kranenburg, &amp; Juffer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1" rid="c50">Smyke et al., 2007</xref>). More specifically, a caregiving quality score composed of ratings of sensitivity, stimulation of development, positive regard for child, flat affect (reversed), and detachment (reversed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-2" rid="c50">Smyke et al., 2007</xref>) was related to children&#8217;s Bayley Developmental Quotients (DQs; a standardized age-invariant measure of behavioral development) as well as competence and less negative behavior on the Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">Carter, Briggs-Gowan, Jones, &amp; Little, 2003</xref>). Further, positive caregiving quality, as defined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-3" rid="c50">Smyke et al., 2007</xref>), especially caregiver sensitivity, positive regard for the child, and engagement, was related to improvement in height and weight among institutionalized children randomly assigned to foster care (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-2" rid="c27">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, a quasi-experimental intervention that emphasized warm, sensitive, and contingently responsive caregiving in regular staff (among other factors) of a St. Petersburg (Russian Federation) institution produced substantial improvements in both Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI) DQs and physical growth measures without changes in nutrition and medical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1" rid="c53">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A. Orphanage Research Team, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">A variety of structural characteristics (SCs) of institutions can either support or inhibit the ability of caregivers to provide sufficient warm, sensitive, contingently responsive, and child-directed care to individual children. For example, if group sizes and children:caregiver ratios are large and children experience many and changing caregivers and peers, it is difficult for caregivers to provide individual children with appropriate interactions. Such factors have been found to limit the effectiveness of caregivers to support children&#8217;s development in nonresidential care and education (see Method section). Conversely, the St. Petersburg intervention changed these and other SCs and produced substantial improvements in all aspects of children&#8217;s development, whereas a training-only intervention without these structural changes had much less effect.</p>
<p align="left">This correlational evidence on individual differences in caregiver&#8211;child interactions and quasi-experimental interventions point generally to the quality of caregiver&#8211;child interactions, especially engagement, sensitivity, and responsiveness, plus an environment that permits frequent one-on-one caregiver&#8211;child interactions as potential contributing factors. But it is a separate question whether naturally occurring differences in these characteristics between institutions are related to differences in children&#8217;s physical and behavioral development. The current study was aimed at addressing this question. There are only two other studies known to the authors in which more than one institution was compared using the same measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-2" rid="c20">Groark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-2" rid="c52">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A. Orphanage Research Team, 2005</xref>), but in both cases, the institutions did not differ much from each other.</p>

<title>Research Aim</title>
<p align="left">The major purpose of the current study was to describe structural differences among three institutions in and around a major Central American city serving infants and young children and to relate those differences to differences in caregiver&#8211;child interactions and children&#8217;s physical (i.e., height, weight, weight per height, head circumference) and behavioral (i.e., adaptive, personal&#8211;social, communication, motor, cognition) development. The three institutions varied in characteristics that are thought to be related to children&#8217;s development. For example, one had received training in caregiver&#8211;child interactions and another had fewer children per caregiver as well as more transient volunteers to play with children. The use of transient volunteers is an emerging international child welfare issue, because some professionals feel their presence is harmful, adding to children&#8217;s exposure to even more and changing caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1" rid="c44">Richter &amp; Norman, 2010</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, no empirical data of any kind exist comparing institutions with, versus without, transient volunteers.</p>

<title>Institutions</title>
<p align="left">Three institutions in and around a capital city of a Central American country were selected to participate by the government because they were the only government-supported institutions in that area serving infants and young children. Government-supported institutions were of interest to the investigators because of the future potential to assess and improve other institutions in the country. The three institutions were willing to participate in this project and had somewhat different physical facilities, funding bases, locations, and sizes.</p>
<sec id="s5" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Institutional SCs</title>
<p align="left">Institution directors were asked a set of questions that provided general information on the institutions&#8217; SCs. These characteristics are known to be related to children&#8217;s development. Specifically, the literature on nonresidential early care and education indicates that group size, children:caregiver ratios, and the number of different caregivers are related to a variety of aspects of children&#8217;s development (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Anderson, Nagle, Roberts, &amp; Smith, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Barnas &amp; Cummings, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Howes, Matheson, &amp; Hamilton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">Kontos &amp; Fiene, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Kontos, Howes, Shinn, &amp; Galinsky, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Love, Schochet, &amp; Meckstroth, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">Peters &amp; Pence, 1992</xref>). In addition, fewer and more consistent caregivers theoretically contribute to better one-on-one caregiver&#8211;child interactions, permit caregivers to be more sensitive and contingently responsive to children&#8217;s overtures, and contribute to caregiver&#8211;child relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Ainsworth, Bell, &amp; Stayton, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Bowlby, 1958</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">1969</xref>). Integration of groups by age, gender, and disability status is not common in residential or nonresidential group care of infants and young children, but such integration potentially can contribute to children&#8217;s development (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Bailey, Burchinal, &amp; McWilliam, 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Bailey, McWilliam, Ware, &amp; Burchinal, 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">Buysse &amp; Bailey, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Chandler, Lubeck, &amp; Fowler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">DeKlyen &amp; Odom, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Guralnick, Connor, Hammond, Gottman, &amp; Kinnish, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">McEvoy, Odom, &amp; McConnell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1" rid="c41">Odom &amp; Bailey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Odom &amp; Brown, 1993</xref>). A quasi-experimental intervention in an institution in St. Petersburg (Russian Federation) that changed all of these SCs to be more positive produced substantial increases in resident children&#8217;s physical, cognitive, and social&#8211;emotional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-2" rid="c53">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A. Research Team, 2008</xref>). In addition, other studies in institutions that have successfully improved children&#8217;s development had one or another of these characteristics as part of their interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-1" rid="c49">Smyke, Dumitrescu, &amp; Zeanah, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">Sparling, Dragomir, Ramey, &amp; Florescu, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">A summary of this information for the three institutions in the current study is presented in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-1" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. These data must be viewed as approximate descriptions of these institutions, because such elements change periodically and may not be precisely correct on the specific day(s) of assessment.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl1"/></p>
<p align="left">Specifically, <italic>Institution A</italic> was substantially larger than the other two institutions, had more children per ward (10&#8211;12), had a higher children:caregiver ratio (11:1), but also had more aides (who do not interact much with children) and specialists (who deliver specialized therapeutic services to children). It had more age integration in wards for younger children and did not routinely &#8220;graduate&#8221; children to new wards.</p>
<p align="left">Institution A also had been part of an intervention implemented approximately 2 years previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">McCall et al., 2010b</xref>) by Whole Child International, a nonprofit U.S. organization devoted to improving institutions for infants and young children. This intervention produced improvements in Infant Toddler/Early Childhood Environmental Rating Scale (ITERS/ECERS) environmental scores, caregiver&#8211;child interactions, and children&#8217;s Battelle DQs. Further, Institution A received additional training and made certain structural changes before the current assessments. Seven training sessions were held for 19 staff members (16 caregivers, most of whom were new hires). In addition, technical assistance was provided in the wards containing children 4 years of age and younger, which focused mainly on routines, communication, play materials, having children&#8217;s photos available, safety, and documentation (&#8220;baby books&#8221; for each child). Also, efforts were made to keep children in the same groups and not &#8220;graduate&#8221; them from one group of peers and caregivers to another when they reached certain developmental milestones, a practice that has been found to be associated with reduced improvement in Battelle scores in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-2" rid="c36">McCall et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">McCall et al., 2012</xref>). This practice has meant that several of the wards have become more age-integrated than they had been. Thus, it might be expected that Institution A would display better caregiver&#8211;child interactions and Battelle scores than the other institutions, but it also had the highest children:caregiver ratio (11:1), which might diminish the amount of caregiver&#8211;child interaction children actually received.</p>
<p align="left"><italic>Institution B</italic> had only three wards. It specialized in taking children who had been malnourished, and provided them with special diets. It was more homogenous by age in wards for younger children, routinely graduated children to new wards, and experienced more staff turnover than the other two institutions. <italic>Institution C</italic> was located in a rural area outside of the main city and had more spacious and well-equipped facilities, fewer children in a ward (5), lower children:caregiver ratios (5:1), and fewer different caregivers assigned to a ward (2), but many other adults (e.g., international volunteers) who were available to play with children, often for only a week or 2 but some for months. These characteristics are usually associated with better children&#8217;s development.</p>

<title>Assessment Battery</title>
<p align="left">This study used assessments of caregiver&#8211;child interactions, and children&#8217;s atypical behaviors and physical and behavioral/cognitive development. Details of the definitions, scoring, procedures, and score sheets for instruments in the assessment battery can be viewed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="live" xlink:href="http://www.ocd.pitt.edu/Evaluation-Tools/223/Default.aspx" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ocd.pitt.edu/Evaluation-Tools/223/Default.aspx</ext-link>).</p>
<sec id="s7" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Caregiver&#8211;child interaction</title>
<p align="left">The Caregiver&#8211;Child Social, Emotional, Relationship Rating Scale (CCSERRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">McCall, Groark, &amp; Fish, 2010a</xref>) was created previously specifically for use in institutions and provides ratings of individual caregivers on a few fundamental dimensions of caregiver&#8211;child interactions. However, the original CCSERRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-2" rid="c35">McCall et al., 2010a</xref>) contained 18 items to be rated, so it was condensed to 9 items (hereafter called CCSERRS-Brief) to fit the time demands of the current assessment battery. This was done primarily by combining the separate items on the original CCSERRS that pertained to positive and negative displays of the same behavior into a single item ranging from negative to positive.</p>
<p align="left">Five items rated an individual caregiver from 0 to 3 (most positive) on <italic>engagement with the children, responsiveness to children&#8217;s overtures, child- versus caregiver-directed interactions, disciplinary control (control and punishment vs. support, empathy, guidance), and positive and appropriate affect</italic>. Children with whom the caregiver interacted were rated as a group on their relative <italic>engagement with the individual caregiver, the extent to which the children responded to the caregiver&#8217;s initiatives, and children&#8217;s appropriate and positive display of affect</italic>. A final item rated the extent of the <italic>caregiver&#8211;children mutual relationship</italic>. The three child items listed previously were included as a partial check on the caregiver ratings; although caregivers might display behaviors with the children they think observers expect of them, children would respond positively only if the caregiver&#8217;s behavior was common in their experience and would not respond if the caregiver was behaving in a unique way for the purpose of the assessment.</p>
<p align="left">Reliability and validity information is available for the original 18-item CCSERRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-3" rid="c35">McCall et al., 2010a</xref>). More generally, the basic behavioral dimensions represented on the condensed CCSERRS-Brief used in this study have been found to relate to children&#8217;s physical, cognitive, and motor development, as reviewed previously.</p>
<p align="left">Formal reliabilities for the current study were conducted in one institution (i.e., Institution A, see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-2" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The four assessors were each paired with each of the other three, and each pair assessed a ward such that assessors were distributed across different wards to the extent possible. To begin a ward assessment, one assessor would enter the ward and stand in the middle of the children for 3 min and both assessors would count the number of indiscriminately friendly children (see Children&#8217;s Behavior Scale [CBS] in later text). Then, CCSERRS-Brief observations were made on the caregivers present and during as many of the three activities (feeding, changing/bathing, and free play) as possible. Over all pairs, 5 episodes of feeding were rated on four caregivers, 13 episodes of bathing/changing were rated on six caregivers, and 10 episodes of free play were rated on five caregivers for a total of 28, 5-min episodes of nine ratings each (252 pairs of ratings on individual items).</p>
<p align="left">Thus, although not uniform, reliabilities were determined on a sample that represented the diversity of activities, wards, caregivers, children in this institution, and assessors, but it precluded the usual statistical assessments of reliability (e.g., Kappa). So, over all paired items, 48% were scored identically and 92% were scored identically or within one point on the 0&#8211;3 scale. The percent of identical ratings and those within one point were similar across the four assessors and caregiver versus child items. Also, the mean ratings per caregiver over all items, episodes, and activities were similar for the four assessors (2.02, 2.00, 2.14, and 2.06), and the average difference in these means between pairs of assessors was .12% or 5.8% of the total score. Thus, assessors were in substantial agreement on the level of caregiver&#8211;child interactions.</p>

<title>Children&#8217;s Behavior Scale</title>
<p align="left">This was a new assessment that consisted of a count of the number of children who display behaviors that in the experience of the authors in numerous institutions commonly occur in institutionalized children but would be regarded as inappropriate and atypical of noninstitutionalized (i.e., parent-reared) children. One such behavior was <italic>indiscriminate friendliness</italic>, which was assessed once in each ward by having an assessor unfamiliar to the children enter the ward during unstructured time, stand in the middle of the ward for 3 min, and count the number of different children who touched or came close to the assessor for a prolonged period.</p>
<p align="left">The remaining items on the CBS represent counts of the number of different children displaying a specific behavior during a 5-min observation period. One of the target behaviors was <italic>stereotypic/self-stimulation</italic>, in which the child engages in a repetitive action for at least 15 seconds. <italic>Self-regulation problems</italic> could occur in three different ways: (1) excessive, unfocused, and impulsive activity; (2) impatience and overreactions to frustration; and (3) problems of state regulation, in which the child overreacts to stimulation or situations. The number of children displaying <italic>extreme withdrawal</italic> for at least 15 s was counted. <italic>Aggressive behavior</italic> could occur when a child was provocative (deliberate attempt to annoy without reasonable cause), destructive (inappropriate violence toward objects or self-destructive behaviors), or interpersonally aggressive and violent (the child deliberately hits, kicks, bites others). The CBS was only appropriate for wards in which most of the children were at least 18 months of age or older. Because it scores the number of children who display a specific type of behavior, it potentially is influenced by the number of children in the ward, so counts were divided by the number of ambulatory children who were present, giving an average rate per child per ward.</p>
<p align="left">Because the CBS could only be administered in wards having a majority of children 18 months or older, reliability information was obtained for only four of the six pairs of assessors. Three of the four assessors were paired with two others and one with one other, and they provided nine paired administrations and 45 pairs of ratings on the CBS items. Most item counts were 0, which precludes even typical percent agreement statistics. However, if one assessor gave a 0 (37 items), the other assessor also gave it a 0 on 84% of those items (31 items). If either assessor gave a non-0 count of any size (10 items), the other assessor also gave it a non-0 count on 40% (4 items). All items were scored within a count of 1 of each other. For the total number of children displaying any of these atypical behaviors (i.e., CBS total score), the Spearman rank-order correlation for the nine pairs was <italic>r</italic><sub location="post">S</sub> = .86. Given the infrequency of these behaviors, the short time of the observations, and the sparse reliability data, the CBS is probably best considered simply a structured observation suggestive of whether atypical child behaviors occurred in the wards. However, in the experience of the senior authors, such behaviors are indicative of relatively poor caregiver&#8211;child interactions, and they are markedly reduced when caregiver&#8211;child interactions are improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-3" rid="c53">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A. Orphanage Research Team, 2008</xref>). Moreover, these behaviors are rarely systematically assessed, so some data may be better than no data on these behaviors.</p>

<title>Physical growth</title>
<p align="left">Children were measured for height (recumbent length for children under 24 months), weight, and head circumference. Growth measures were converted to <italic>z</italic> scores (mean <italic>z</italic> = .00, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.00) using the U.S Centers for Disease Control (CDC) standards. The CDC standards are regarded as the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; and used throughout the world, and growth standards for infants and young children do not vary much by race or ethnicity (Johnson, personal communication, April 5, 2010 and October 2012). However, the computer program used to make this conversion does not calculate it for the 22 children (mostly abandoned) who lacked a birth date (except for weight-per-height) or for extreme measurement values (a restriction that was overridden for weight-per-height). It converts head circumference only for children at or less than 36 months.</p>
<p align="left">Physical growth of children is known to be related to psychosocial factors, specifically the warm, sensitive, responsive, and one-on-one caregiver&#8211;child interactions emphasized on the CCSERRS-Brief (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Blizzard, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Johnson, 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-3" rid="c27">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-4" rid="c53">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A.

Further, physical growth of institutionalized children is related to their general behavioral development (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-4" rid="c27">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>), and physical growth improves along with general behavioral development as a function of improving the caregiver&#8211;child interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-5" rid="c53">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A. Orphanage Research Team, 2008</xref>). Thus, physical growth could be used as the primary child outcome measure in field studies because it can be measured quickly on many children by minimally trained assessors.</p>

<title>Children&#8217;s cognitive and behavioral development</title>
<p align="left">The Spanish version of the revised BDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">LINC Associates, 2008</xref>) was used to assess the children&#8217;s general behavioral and cognitive development. The BDI is individually administered to children accompanied by the caregiver who knows the child best. It yields a total DQ as well as DQs for five subscales, including adaptive (primarily dressing, eating, and other self-supporting activities), personal&#8211;social, communication, motor, and cognitive development. Scores were converted to DQs (mean DQ = 100, <italic>SD</italic> = 15) by a proprietary program (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-2" rid="c31">LINC Associates, 2008</xref>) on the basis of a U.S. standardization sample of home-reared children, but the program does not calculate total DQs &lt;45 or subscale DQs &lt;55, assigning this cutoff value to such cases. Similar to growth measures, age is required for this conversion, and this was not known for all children.</p>
<p align="left">For reliability purposes, one assessor administered the BDI, and all three assessors privately scored each item, producing raw scores for each subscale and total scores, which were then submitted to the conversion software that produced DQs for each subscale and the total. The three assessors jointly administered the BDI to nine children from four different wards in Institution A, who ranged in age from 5 to 64 months with a median of 43 months.</p>
<p align="left">Because all three assessors could be paired with each other for all nine children, more conventional reliability statistics could be calculated. The average total DQ difference between pairs of assessors was 2.2, or approximately 2.5% of total DQ. Spearman correlations across the nine children for each of the three pairs of assessors were .80 to.97 for total DQ and .85 to 1.00 for the five subscales. Intraclass correlations across the set of three assessors were .93 for total DQ and .87 to .97 for the five subscales. Finally, an analysis of variance on total DQ was conducted with child and assessors as the independent variables. Highly significant differences occurred for children, <italic>F</italic>(8, 16) = 38.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> = .95, whereas the effect for assessor was nonsignificant, <italic>F</italic>(10, 20) &lt;1.00. Thus, 95% of the variance was associated with children and a nonsignificant 1% with assessor. Children accounted for 91% to 98% of the variance for individual subscales.</p>

<title>U.S. standardization samples</title>
<p align="left">Both physical growth and behavioral/cognitive development measures were converted to age-invariant scores (<italic>z</italic>, DQ) using U.S. standards for noninstitutionalized children. Such conversions provide scores that can be compared across children of different ages, a virtual necessity in a study like this. Could not local standardization samples be used? More regional growth standards exist, but they do not provide the precision (i.e., short intervals, measurement rigor) that the CDC standards possess. Growth is similar across racial/ethnic groups of infants and young children, so the CDC conversion is often preferred for international growth assessments. There is no local standardization sample for the Battelle. Is it fair to compare institutionalized children with noninstitutionalized children? This is only an issue when direct comparisons are actually made (e.g., percent children considered &#8220;stunted&#8221; or scoring less than DQ = 70), but of little concern when comparing children between institutions.</p>

<sec id="s12" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p align="left">Because this was a field study in operating institutions, the assessments had to be conducted partly or completely with most caregivers and children in a single institution in a few days before moving to the next institution, all with minimum intrusiveness and disruption to the typical routines of the institutions. This led to more irregularities of procedures and missing data (see &#8220;Limitations&#8221;) than would be expected in a primarily scientific project with more comprehensive and intensive assessments.</p>
<sec id="s13" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Training of assessors</title>
<p align="left">Four assessors were used. They were psychologists or graduate students in psychology, child development, or a related discipline at a local university. One assessor was experienced with the original CCSERRS and the Battelle from a previous project (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-3" rid="c20">Groark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-3" rid="c36">McCall et al., 2010b</xref>), three others were trained to conduct the observations on the wards, and two of them were trained to administer the Battelle and physical growth measurements.</p>
<p align="left">Training was conducted by authors Groark and McCall, the creators of some of the assessments, and consisted of 2 days of group sessions devoted primarily to reviewing the definition of each item to be rated or counted on each assessment. Subsequently, practice sessions were held at a preschool and an elementary school. Two assessors went with each of the assessment creators, made 5-min observations and ratings, and then discussed the ratings made on each item to achieve uniformity of definition and perception. This was repeated frequently until assessors achieved some degree of concordance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s14" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>CCSERRS-Brief and CBS</title>
<p align="left">Assessments conducted on the wards focused on an individual caregiver and the group of children she served at that time. At the beginning, an assessor unfamiliar to the children in that ward (only wards in which most children were older than 18 months) would enter the room and stand in the middle of the ward for 3 min, counting the number of children who touched her or remained close to her for an extended period (CBS assessment of indiscriminate friendliness).</p>
<p align="left">Then, the assessor would arbitrarily select a caregiver and begin the CCSERRS-Brief assessment. She observed the caregiver for 5 min (called an <italic>episode</italic>) during one <italic>activity</italic> (feeding, changing/bathing, or free play) and then made the nine CCSERRS-Brief ratings. Then another caregiver would be rated in that activity, and CCSERRS-Brief ratings would continue ideally for at least two episodes of that activity for each caregiver. When that activity was finished (e.g., all children were fed), observations under that activity were regarded as completed, and observations were conducted again on the same caregivers when they were engaged in another activity (i.e., changing/bathing, free play). For each CCSERRS-Brief item, the scores on each episode within an activity were averaged (if only one episode, those single scores were used), and then the mean of those three activity averages constituted the caregiver&#8217;s score on that item. Because some activities did not last long, especially in wards with few children, not every caregiver had ratings for two episodes in each of three activities. Consequently, for some analyses, caregivers had to have at least one episode in each of three activities; for other analyses, a caregiver had to have at least one episode in two different activities to be included. CCSERRS-Brief scores were compared for caregivers having at least one episode in all three activities versus only two activities; the latter mean scores were similar across wards and institutions to the former, suggesting that no bias was introduced by using only two of three activities.</p>
<p align="left">After all caregivers present in the ward at one time were assessed with the CCSERRS-Brief on one episode within one activity, an additional 5-min observation was made to score the CBS if the ward contained a majority of children 18 months or older. After the CBS was scored, CCSERRS-Brief observations were continued, followed by another episode of the CBS. Thus, the number of CBS episodes also depended on the number of caregivers present and how long an activity took to complete for all children present. Assessors might return to a ward to complete ratings for one or another activity. But, because caregivers may work on different days, a different assessor might rate other caregivers for a specific ward on subsequent days.</p>

<title>Physical growth</title>
<p align="left">Children&#8217;s physical growth was measured following approximately the World Health Organization procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">de Onis, Onyango, Van de Broeck, Chumlea, &amp; Martorell, 2004</xref>). Children younger than 24 months were measured for recumbent length with a stadiometer, and they were weighed being held by a caregiver whose own weight was subtracted from the combined weight. Children were weighed clothed, and several samples of typical clothing were weighed, and the weight of clothing similar to what a child was wearing was subtracted from the observed weight of the clothed child to estimate nude weight.</p>

<sec id="s16" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Battelle</title>
<p align="left">The Battelle was administered to individual children accompanied by the caregiver who knew the child best who was available on testing days according to the standard Battelle administration practices. Because the BDI is individually administered and may take more than an hour to complete, BDI assessments took place over several weeks after the ward assessments were completed, and some children arrived and departed over this interval. Thus, such an assessment might not be included in field studies of many institutions.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s18" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Caregiver&#8211;Child Interactions</title>
<p align="left">Mean (<italic>SD</italic>) total CCSERRS-Brief scores for Institution A (2.29; .22), B (2.06; .43), and C (2.20; .33) were significantly different from one another, <italic>F</italic>(2, 31) = 5.36, <italic>p</italic> = .01, &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> = .26, when using scores only from caregivers who had at least one episode in each of the three activities.</p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-1" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> presents the means (<italic>SD</italic>s), <italic>N</italic>s, and significance tests among the three institutions for the nine individual items of the CCSERRS-Brief and the total score. Significant institutional differences occurred for caregiver engagement, caregiver responsiveness, caregiver affect, child responsiveness, child affect, and caregiver&#8211;child relationship.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl2"/></p>
<p align="left">Although the small <italic>Ns</italic> in Institutions B and C make pairwise statistical comparisons somewhat dubious, the overall results support three trends that can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-2" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. First, caregivers in Institution A scored higher than B and C on every one of the nine items. Presumably, this reflects the training most of these caregivers received, which emphasized many of the behaviors rated on the CCSERRS-Brief. Second, scores for the child ratings were essentially as high as for the caregiver ratings for all three institutions. This was especially important for Institution A, because it suggests that the high caregiver ratings do not simply reflect caregivers behaving in ways in which they were trained solely for this assessment; that is, the children responded in kind, indicating they had experienced these behaviors before. Third, whereas the ratings for caregivers and children were about the same in Institutions A (2.22, 2.18) and B (1.82, 1.72), scores for children (2.02) were somewhat higher than for caregivers (1.79) in C. This may be related to the substantial amount of adult&#8211;child interactions these children received from volunteers.</p>

<title>Child Behavior Scale</title>
<p align="left">Although the data are sparse because of the few observational episodes and the fact that the CBS can only be assessed in wards in which most children are 18 months and older, the mean percentages of CBS items for ambulatory children available per 5-min observation in the three institutions are presented in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc3-1" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl3"/></p>
<p align="left">Although statistical comparisons are not possible because of the lean data, Institution C appears different than Institutions A and B. In A, three of four wards displayed at least one instance on one coding episode of indiscriminate friendliness, self-stimulation, and aggressive behavior, and one ward had one instance of self-regulation problems. In Institution B, one ward had an instance of indiscriminate friendliness, and the other ward had at least some children displaying self-stimulation and self-regulation problems. The percentages are low because none of these behaviors were observed during most 5-min observations. In contrast, many children in Institution C were indiscriminately friendly, but they displayed none of the other atypical behaviors.</p>

<title>Children&#8217;s Physical Growth</title>
<p align="left">Mean <italic>z</italic> scores and SDs (mean <italic>z</italic> = .00 in U.S. home-reared population) for children in the three institutions as a function of age at assessment (i.e., birth &#8211; 36 months, &#8805;36 months) are presented in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc4-1" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> for the measures height, weight, weight-per-height, and head circumference. The age factor was considered because caregiver&#8217;s social interactions with institutionalized children tend to have more effect on physical growth, especially head circumference, in younger children (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-5" rid="c27">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-2" rid="c54">Van IJzendoorn et al., 2007</xref>). Height and weight tend to co-vary, so they were analyzed together. Head circumference does not co-vary with height and weight and weight-per-height has a unique interpretation, so they were analyzed separately. The CDC standards do not convert head circumference for children older than 36 months.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl4"/></p>
<p align="left">An Institution &#215; Age-Group multivariate analysis of variance was calculated on height and weight as dependent variables. This analysis produced a significant effect for institution, <italic>F</italic>(4, 144) = 8.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> = .19, and univariate effects for both height, <italic>F</italic>(2, 73) = 3.55, <italic>p</italic> = .034, &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> = .09, and weight, <italic>F</italic>(2, 73) = 10.40, <italic>p</italic> = .009, &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> = .12. A marginal multivariate effect was also observed for age-group, <italic>F</italic>(2, 72) = 2.83, <italic>p</italic> = .066, &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> = .07, in which older children had poorer height but better weight than younger children, but neither univariate effect was significant (<italic>F</italic>s &lt; 1) nor was the Institution &#215; Age-Group interaction. These results show that children in Institution C had substantially better heights and weights (i.e., smaller negative <italic>z</italic> scores), which may be associated with their greater adult&#8211;child social experience. Children in Institution B had the poorest height, but their weight was not so severely deficient, which may reflect the fact that B specialized in taking malnourished children whose height may have been severely compromised, and B&#8217;s special nutritional program may have influenced weight more than height. Children in A were more physically retarded than those in C, despite their higher caregiver&#8211;child interaction scores.</p>
<p align="left">Analyses for weight-per-height produced similar results. There was a significant effect for institution, <italic>F</italic>(2, 72) = 11.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> = .24, and an age-group effect, <italic>F</italic>(1, 72) = 4.09, <italic>p</italic> = .047, &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> = .05. Younger children had less weight-per-height than did older children. Institutions B and C did not have weight-per-height different from noninstitutionalized U.S. children (.26, &#8722;.01), indicating that physical stature was not obviously associated with nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-2" rid="c25">Johnson, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-1" rid="c59">Widdowson, 1951</xref>), but children in A were underweight per height (&#8722;1.20) relative to both children in B (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and C (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .02).</p>
<p align="left">A one-way analysis of variance with institution as the independent variable was conducted on head circumference, with no significant effects, <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1.</p>

Low scores were more prominent for the subscales of cognition (52%) and communications (37%). Differences among the three institutions were large. Institution C had 73% of their children scoring &#8805;80, whereas only 18% of Institution A and 8% of Institution B scored this well. Conversely, Institution C had only 9% (one child) scoring &lt;70, whereas 43% of Institution A and 83% of Institution B did so.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p align="left">This study provides empirical descriptions of the SCs of three Central American institutions for infants and toddlers and assessments of caregiver&#8211;child interactions, children&#8217;s atypical behaviors, and children&#8217;s physical and behavioral/cognitive development. As such, it expands the nature of the measurements and contributes to the recently increasing empirical literature on the nature of these early, and often deficient, rearing environments.</p>
<p align="left">Although these institutions varied substantially on most measures, they were within the range of the world&#8217;s published literature on SCs of such institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-3" rid="c45">Rosas &amp; McCall, in press</xref>), caregiver&#8211;child interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-4" rid="c20">Groark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-4" rid="c35">McCall et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-4" rid="c36">2010b</xref>), and children&#8217;s physical (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-3" rid="c54">Van IJzendoorn et al., 2007</xref>) and behavioral/cognitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-2" rid="c57">Van IJzendoorn et al., 2008</xref>) development.</p>
<sec id="s24" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Differences Among Institutions</title>
<p align="left">Institution A was most typical of those in the published literature. It had relatively large groups (10&#8211;12 children) and 11 children per caregiver during the waking hours. CCSERRS-Brief scores were relatively high for both caregivers and children, which likely reflect the intervention and additional training previously conducted in this institution. But children&#8217;s physical development was poor, and children&#8217;s behavioral/cognitive development was not as high as one might expect, given the high caregiver&#8211;child interaction scores. We speculate that caregivers attempted to implement their training (although we have no information on how prevalent or intensely they implemented it), but the benefit to individual children was minimized by having 11 children per caregiver.</p>
<p align="left">Institution B specialized in taking children who had been malnourished, and it provided supplemental diets once these children were in the institution. However, the quality of caregiver&#8211;child interaction was the lowest of the three institutions, and children&#8217;s height and weight were also poor. In contrast, weight-per-height was the highest in this institution, presumably reflecting the special diets that tend to influence this index but not physical stature (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-3" rid="c25">Johnson, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-2" rid="c59">Widdowson, 1951</xref>). Children&#8217;s average Battelle performance was also lower than the other two institutions, again suggesting the negative influence of a poor psychosocial caregiver&#8211;child environment. However, this institution specialized in taking malnourished children who could have been especially underdeveloped at intake (but see &#8220;Limitations&#8221;).</p>
<p align="left">Institution C was different. It was the smallest institution, had small groups (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and fewer children per caregiver (5:1), and children were more heterogeneously age-grouped than in the other institutions. Moreover, it had numerous additional adults, especially volunteers who came for a week or 2, and sometimes longer, to care for and play with the children. All these factors are associated with better outcomes for children (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-6" rid="c53">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A. Orphanage Research Team, 2008</xref>). But caregiver interaction ratings were not high in quality, although the children&#8217;s ratings were better. The CCSERRS-Brief scores were obtained only on staff caregivers, not on the volunteers. In the experience of the authors, caregivers often defer to visitors and volunteers who want to care for and play with the children, thus producing relatively lower scores for staff caregivers.</p>
<p align="left">Children in Institution C were most indiscriminately friendly, which is usually associated with a lack of personal relationships with at least one caregiver (attachment relationships were not assessed, except by a global rating on the CCSERRS-Brief). But indiscriminate friendliness may also be influenced by the fact that children were accustomed to many new individuals every week or 2 and had learned that they were likely to gain the attention of strange adults by being demonstratively friendly to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Chisholm, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Nevertheless, C&#8217;s SCs (i.e., small groups, low children:caregiver ratio of 5:1 plus volunteers) were good, and the children in C were substantially more advanced in their physical and behavioral/cognitive development in nearly every aspect measured. This observation is at least consistent with the substantial literature pointing toward the positive benefits of frequent one-on-one caregiver&#8211;child interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-6" rid="c27">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-5" rid="c20">Groark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-5" rid="c36">McCall et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-4" rid="c50">Smyke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-7" rid="c53">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A. Orphanage Research Team, 2008</xref>), but in this case, it appears to be provided by volunteers more than staff caregivers. Moreover, the structure of this institution was similar to a quasi-experimental intervention that produced higher physical and behavioral development in Russian institutionalized children (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-8" rid="c53">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A. Orphanage Research Team, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">The one characteristic of Institution C that apparently does not fit the literature is that children had many and changing caregivers in the form of volunteers. Most professionals would argue that fewer and more consistent, rather than many and changing, caregivers are conducive to promoting child&#8211;caregiver relationships and better children&#8217;s development, and thus children in C should have had poor development. But this proposition may need qualification. The practice of having volunteers visit for short periods is highly controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-2" rid="c44">Richter &amp; Norman, 2010</xref>). On one hand, it could be harmful to children in institutions that also have many and changing staff caregivers, because it would contribute to lack of consistency and predictability in caregiving. On the other hand, children in Institution C had two regular caregivers, one of whom was consistently present every day, and they may have provided a secure, consistent, stable base for children. Thus, if a child has one or two consistently present caregivers (i.e., &#8220;parents&#8221;), many other adults (i.e., &#8220;relatives, friends, a village&#8221;) may provide a great deal of one-on-one stimulation to children and contribute positively to at least some aspects of their development.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p align="left">This study is one of the few empirical descriptions of institutions for infants and young children and is unusual because it compares three institutions that differ on several major SCs thought to relate to the quality of care and children&#8217;s development. Although it has the ecological advantages of a naturalistic field study, it has many limitations.</p>
<sec id="s26" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Assessments under field study conditions</title>
<p align="left">Relative to formal experimental research studies in which most circumstances are under the control of the evaluators, field studies in low-resource countries in the imperfect &#8220;laboratories&#8221; of institutions present several challenges.</p>
<p align="left">First, the assessments included in the battery used here produced indicators that the literature documents are related to children&#8217;s physical and behavioral/cognitive development. Further, the correlation between height and weight and children&#8217;s BDI scores joins other literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-7" rid="c27">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>) suggesting that these characteristics co-vary in the institutional context. However, the battery did not cover medical care, nutrition, sanitation, and toys and equipment, which could be included in a more comprehensive assessment of institutional quality. Although such factors can relate to children&#8217;s health and development, especially in situations in which these characteristics might be seriously deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Johnson &amp; Gunner, 2011</xref>), caregiver&#8211;child interaction factors have been shown to relate to children&#8217;s physical and behavioral/cognitive development over and above these medical and health factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-9" rid="c53">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A. Orphanage Research Team, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Second, evaluators had to have substantial tolerance for a variety of changing circumstances within the institutions, the inability to assess all caregivers under all conditions, and uncertain and missing birth dates for children (which are required to scale their physical growth and behavioral development across a wide age range). Caregivers, for example, represent moving targets; many do not work every day, some work night shifts for a period, some are substitutes, and some are on vacation. It is difficult to obtain two separate observations on each of three activities for each caregiver, although obtaining partial data on caregivers produced results similar to obtaining assessments on all three activities. Computer programs to calculate age-invariant scores for physical growth and behavioral/cognitive development do not calculate such scores for children having low values, which are common among institutionalized children, and the use of U.S. standards represents only an approximation to noninstitutionalized children in the local population. However, such limitations must be recognized when conducting field studies of institutions in low-resource countries, which attempt to produce a snapshot in time of the status of the institution and children&#8217;s development using &#8220;the best obtainable information,&#8221; if not the scientific ideal.</p>
<p align="left">Third, several uncontrolled circumstances might have contributed to the results. For example, the developmental status and ages of children at intake were not available, children and caregivers could have spent different lengths of time in each institution, and children and caregiver turnover rates could be different.</p>
<p align="left">Although the authors acknowledge that these uncontrolled factors and differences among the three institutions could contribute to the differences in children&#8217;s development, we speculate that they do not play the major role. Head circumference is sometimes used as an index of early severe adversity, and it is more difficult to improve after 12 to 18 months of age. But the children in these three institutions did not differ in head circumference, which is consistent with the proposition that the groups were not substantially different at intake. Although Institutions A and B had more children with disabilities than C, the criteria for having a disability is not clear, such decisions are made by administrators, and children with severe (including Down Syndrome) or multiple disabilities are assigned to separate institutions specializing in these children. Thus, children with disabilities in Institutions A and B are not likely to be severely limited. Further, Institution A had more children with disabilities, but they scored higher than children in B on the Battelle. Staff turnover was largest in B, and changes in caregivers contribute to lack of stability and less predictability in the environment, factors associated with poorer children&#8217;s development. One study has investigated staff turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">McCall et al., in press</xref>) and found that new caregivers quickly match their caregiving to the level of existing caregivers. Finally, the better development of children in C matches the literature reviewed previously on the benefits of smaller groups, lower children:caregiver ratios, more one-on-one adult interaction, more stability of main caregivers (if not volunteers), and greater age integration within groups. This supports the conclusion that these factors likely played a major role in children&#8217;s developmental status.</p>
<p align="left">Only deliberate experimental manipulations of these factors can more conclusively identify the casual role of these individual factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-10" rid="c53">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A. Orphanage Research Team (2008)</xref> comes the closest, but all these factors were changed simultaneously and the effects of specific elements cannot be teased out. In future observational studies comparing different institutions, researchers should try to obtain a large sample of different institutions, information on the reason for each child&#8217;s relinquishment to the institution, the developmental status of children at intake, records of their residency in institutions, their health and disability status, and actual observational data on SCs and caregiver employment patterns. Although scientifically desirable, such data are often not available (i.e., abandoned children have no birth date) or require a substantial and costly research effort to collect.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Some &#8220;Better Practices&#8221; of Institutional Care</title>
<p align="left">The literature reviewed previously and the differences among these three institutions suggest several &#8220;better practices&#8221; of institutional care that are at least consistent with improved physical and behavioral/cognitive development of institutionalized children (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Groark &amp; McCall, 2011</xref>). <italic>Smaller groups</italic> of children with <italic>fewer children per caregiver</italic> is a recurring characteristic in this study and the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-2" rid="c51">Sparling et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-11" rid="c53">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A. Orphanage Research Team, 2008</xref>). Such an environment provides caregivers the opportunity to interact appropriately and one-on-one with children. <italic>Age integration</italic> within the ward may be helpful, not only because older children &#8220;teach&#8221; younger ones but because caregivers can interact with older children while infants sleep and spend time with infants while older children play by themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-12" rid="c53">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A. Orphanage Research Team, 2008</xref>). Once age integration is implemented, <italic>periodic graduations to new groups of peers and caregivers can be stopped</italic>, which has been shown to promote continued positive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-6" rid="c36">McCall et al., 2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-2" rid="c34">2012</xref>). Caregivers who have been socialized into an institutional mentality and a perfunctory behavioral style can be reoriented with <italic>training and on-the-ward coaching and technical assistance to promote warm, sensitive, responsive, and child-directed interactions with children</italic>. Benefits may be maintained if an <italic>in-house system of monitoring and supervision</italic> is established to encourage caregivers to implement their training on a continuing basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-13" rid="c53">The St. Petersburg-U.S.A.
