<p align="left">Performing a nonfocal prospective memory (PM) task results in a cost to ongoing task processing, but the precise nature of the monitoring processes involved remains unclear. We investigated whether target context specification (i.e., explicitly associating the PM target with a subset of ongoing stimuli) can trigger trial-by-trial changes in task interference according to stimulus relevance for the nonfocal PM task. Participants performed a lexical decision task in which a PM task (press <italic>F6</italic> when a target syllable appeared) was embedded. The target syllable always occurred in word trials, but we manipulated participants&#8217; expectations regarding the target context by instructing them that targets would occur in words only (specific condition) or in both words and nonwords (nonspecific condition). A control condition with no PM demands was also included. Although having a PM task led to noticeable slowing on the ongoing task, specifying the PM target context reduced cost to items irrelevant to the intention (nonwords) while leaving PM performance intact. Moreover, higher cost for nonwords in the nonspecific than specific condition was persistent across the ongoing task even though the target syllable was repeatedly presented in words. These results suggest that stimulus processing can be modulated according to participants&#8217; expectations about the lexical properties of the target, with trial-by-trial changes in task interference as a function of stimulus relevance to a nonfocal intention observed as a consequence.</p>

<p align="left">Prospective memory (PM) refers to remembering to carry out an intended action at some point in the future without any explicit reminders to do so (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Einstein &amp; McDaniel, 1990</xref>). These actions range from remembering to take medication to remembering to buy tickets for a performance that is likely to sell out. Around half of daily memory failures may be attributable to PM misses (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">Kliegel &amp; Martin, 2003</xref>). Generally, these go unnoticed or are retrieved at an alternative time without great consequence. Nevertheless, the failure of some PMs can have serious consequences as revealed, for instance, by the surprising statistic that one fifth of airline accidents can be attributed to intention-related failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Dismukes &amp; Nowinski, 2006</xref>). Because of the high prevalence of delayed intentions in everyday personal and work life (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Parker, Garry, Einstein, &amp; McDaniel, 2011</xref>) and the seriousness of potential consequences of PM failures, it is important that research continues to develop to improve understanding of PM.</p>
<p align="left">Two general categories of theories explain how individuals maintain and retrieve intentions. The multiprocess view (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">McDaniel &amp; Einstein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">McDaniel, Guynn, Einstein, &amp; Breneiser, 2004</xref>) proposes a flexible system in which PM retrieval can rely either on resource-demanding monitoring processes or on spontaneous processes. According to this view, the characteristics of the ongoing and PM tasks as well as of the individual determine whether monitoring processes are needed for successful PM performance. By contrast, the preparatory attentional and memory processes (PAM; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1" rid="c41">Smith &amp; Bayen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Smith, Hunt, McVay, &amp; McConnell, 2007</xref>) theory proposes that PM performance is always dependent on resource-demanding preparatory attentional processes being engaged before the target event occurs. These processes (e.g., nonautomatic monitoring, rehearsal of the PM target events) can occur outside the focus of attention or be strategic monitoring processes that are fully available to awareness but will always consume attentional resources. Therefore, ongoing task cost has been consistently relied on to draw inferences about the processes involved in PM task performance.</p>
<p align="left">The multiprocess and PAM theories converge in their assumption that monitoring is a resource-demanding process that requires allocation of limited cognitive resources toward monitoring the environment for the occurrence of PM targets. When the properties of the target associated with the intention are not the focus of ongoing task processing, PM targets are referred to as <italic>nonfocal</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-2" rid="c29">McDaniel &amp; Einstein, 2000</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Maylor, 1996</xref>). The multiprocess view assumes that attention-demanding monitoring processes need to be engaged for successful performance with nonfocal PM tasks and, as such, both theories predict that significant ongoing task cost should be observed when the target is nonfocal.</p>
<p align="left">Previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Einstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Scullin, McDaniel, Shelton, &amp; Lee, 2010</xref>) has already established that performing a nonfocal PM task results in a cost to ongoing task processing. Our interest in the present study was in determining whether associating a nonfocal PM task with a subset of stimuli can trigger trial-by-trial changes in task interference according to the stimulus relevance to the intention. Thus, we asked participants to perform an ongoing lexical decision task (LDT) together with a PM task (responding to the syllable <italic>tor</italic>) and manipulated participants&#8217; expectations regarding the target context by explicitly instructing them that targets would occur in word trials only or in both word and nonword trials. By focusing on a manipulation of target context specification, the present approach should help reveal the nature of the processes underlying nonfocal PM retrieval.</p>
<p align="left">Although examining the extent to which monitoring is necessary for PM performance has been the focus of much research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-2" rid="c10">Einstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Knight et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">Scullin, McDaniel, &amp; Einstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-2" rid="c42">Smith et al., 2007</xref>), studies investigating whether task interference exerts a general effect or whether it involves trial-by-trial changes in the allocation of attention are scarce. In one study, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Marsh, Cook, and Hicks (2006)</xref> examined if task interference can change flexibly as a result of material specific processing, that is, whether cost would be reduced for stimuli not relevant to the intention. In line with their view positing local task interference effects, the authors showed a reduction in task interference for the irrelevant material (e.g., picture trials when the intention was to perform an action to furniture words) when presentation of word and picture trials was blocked or when participants could predict the nature of the upcoming trial (i.e., when a cue was presented at the start of each trial; Experiments 1B&#8211;3) but not when relevant and irrelevant stimuli were presented at random (Experiment 1A).</p>
<p align="left">Although <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-2" rid="c23">Marsh, Cook, and Hicks (2006</xref>, Experiment 1A) found no evidence of greater interference for intention-relevant than intention-irrelevant material when trials were varied at random with no cuing, this result may have been uniquely tied to their particular approach. Specifically, their ongoing task required participants to continuously and randomly switch between two task judgments (i.e., naming pictures and reading words). The need to coordinate two tasks and randomly load distinct production rules should impair performance by likely taxing central executive resources. According to the task-switching literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Duncan, 1995</xref>), the need to switch between tasks unpredictably from trial to trial causes task uncertainty, which increases the resource demands of ongoing cognitive processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-3" rid="c23">Marsh, Cook, &amp; Hicks, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Marsh, Hancock, &amp; Hicks, 2002</xref>). By contrast, our ongoing task is likely to be less effortful and expensive in terms of resources as all ongoing trials involve the same material and response type (i.e., lexical decision) and, hence, there is no need to continuously switch between task sets.</p>
<p align="left">Moreover, in contrast with <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-4" rid="c23">Marsh, Cook, and Hicks&#8217;s (2006)</xref> lack of evidence for trial-by-trial modulation of task interference when relevant and irrelevant stimuli were presented at random, recent results suggest that item-level changes in monitoring might occur at least under some circumstances. Thus, a few studies have reported significant task interference to word trials in an ongoing LDT in the absence of cost to nonword trials when a set of words were used as PM targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Cohen, Jaudas, &amp; Gollwitzer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">Smith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-3" rid="c42">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; but for different results see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Loft &amp; Yeo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-2" rid="c39">Smith, 2003</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Cohen, Jaudas, Hirschhorn, Sobin, and Gollwitzer (2012)</xref> investigated task interference for word and nonword trials in a LDT when PM targets were a set of either words or nonwords. Having an intention selectively interfered with items relevant to the PM task such that cost was observed for items that matched the intention but not for those that did not (stimulus-specific interference effect). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Knight, Ethridge, Marsh, and Clementz (2010)</xref> reported that when participants performed a LDT and the PM task consisted of responding to word items in one of seven possible colors, slowing from the baseline to the PM block was observed for filler words but not for nonwords. Because a no-PM control group was not included, the authors were unable to establish whether task interference for nonword trials was completely eliminated. Nonetheless, Knight et al.&#8217;s results clearly showed that the cost to nonword trials from having a complex PM task (i.e., target defined by both lexicality and color) was at least reduced.</p>
<p align="left">Although existing findings are suggestive, more research is warranted before it can be firmly concluded that item-level changes in task interference can be observed as a function of ongoing stimulus relevance to the PM task. A commonality between the above studies is that the PM task conditions implied that targets could only appear in a portion of trials (e.g., word trials in a LDT when targets were a set of words). In the present study, we took a different approach by selecting a nonfocal target (syllable <italic>tor</italic>) that could, in principle, occur in any ongoing lexical decision trial. By manipulating target context specification, we were then able to examine task interference when the intention was linked versus not linked to a specific context (i.e., when participants were explicitly instructed that the PM targets would occur only in a subset of ongoing trials vs. any trial). It is important to note that regardless of the instructions, the target syllable always occurred in word trials and, as such, the objective PM demands were exactly the same for all participants.</p>
<p align="left">Previous research has shown that participants can use monitoring processes in an efficient way by limiting deployment of monitoring to the task in which the PM targets are expected. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Marsh, Hicks, and Cook (2006)</xref> showed that context-linking an intention to a distal phase of the experiment eliminated task interference during the context preceding the PM phase (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-2" rid="c17">Knight et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Scullin &amp; Bugg, 2013</xref>). Yet, in the real world, the general retrieval context might be known, but the intention might lack specification. For example, you might form the intention to meet a particular researcher at a poster presentation. This might prove a difficult task unless you have further details about the researcher&#8217;s appearance (e.g., height, age, glasses, or other key features that you have identified from his or her website photo) that can support you in monitoring the conference attendees for the target researcher. Accordingly, a provocative possibility is that conditions that explicitly inform participants about the specific items where targets can occur will allow them to adopt more efficient monitoring strategies, including recruiting additional attentional resources associated with target-related processing (e.g., recognition checks) only when stimuli that are relevant to the intention are encountered. Such changes would result in a monitoring pattern characterized by distinct task interference levels for ongoing task items relevant and irrelevant for the intention.</p>
<p align="left">In sum, our main aim was to examine whether target context specification can trigger item-level changes in task interference as a function of the stimulus relevance to the nonfocal PM task. Relevant and irrelevant contexts were varied at random on a trial-by-trial basis within a single ongoing task by asking participants to perform a LDT and to give a PM response to a particular syllable. Although the target syllable always occurred in word trials, we manipulated participants&#8217; expectations about the target context at instructions by telling them either that the syllable would always occur in words or that it could occur in both words and nonwords (specific and nonspecific conditions, respectively). We hypothesized that task interference for nonword trials would be reduced when the PM target context was specified. In addition, we predicted that this reduction for the stimuli not associated with the intention would have no impact on PM performance as targets never occurred in nonword trials. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Loft, Kearney, and Remington (2008)</xref> have shown that task interference can decline across the ongoing task when PM targets are not presented. An open question in the present study was whether resource allocation to nonword trials in the nonspecific condition would remain constant across the ongoing task or, instead, decline as the PM targets were repeatedly and without exception presented in word trials despite participants&#8217; expectations.</p>

<title>Design and Participants</title>
<p align="left">The design was a 3 &#215; 2 mixed factorial, with condition (control, specific, nonspecific) as the between-subjects factor and block (baseline, PM) as the within-subjects factor. Participants aged 18&#8211;24 years (<italic>M</italic> = 20.4 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.5) were undergraduate students from Warwick University and were an opportunity sample. One hundred five participants (58 women) were randomly assigned to the control (<italic>n</italic> = 28), specific (<italic>n</italic> = 38), and nonspecific (<italic>n</italic> = 39) conditions. Four participants (one control, two specific, one nonspecific) were excluded as detailed in the Results section. Testing took place individually in sessions lasting approximately 25 min. During the session, participants completed the Digit Symbol Substitution task (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">Wechsler, 1981</xref>). Analysis revealed no main effect of condition, indicating that participants randomly assigned to the different conditions were equivalent on this measure of processing speed (<italic>M</italic> = 67.9, 70.8, and 68.0 and <italic>SD</italic> = 9.5, 9.5, and 10.2 for the control, specific, and nonspecific conditions, respectively, <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1).</p>

<sec id="s4" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<p align="left">Participants were first given instructions about the LDT where they were told to decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether a string of letters was a word. They were told to press the <italic>J</italic> key with their right index finger if the string was a word and the <italic>F</italic> key with their left index finger if it was not a word. It was added that after each decision, a <italic>waiting</italic> message would appear on the screen and that they should press the space bar with one of their thumbs to see the next item. Participants were asked to summarize the instructions before starting the baseline block.</p>
<p align="left">At the end of the baseline block, participants were given instructions for the PM block. All participants were told that they would be completing another block of the LDT and were reminded that they should respond as quickly and accurately as possible. Those in the PM conditions were additionally given instructions for the PM task. Namely, participants were told that whenever they saw the syllable <italic>tor</italic> they should press the <italic>F6</italic> key after they made their lexical decision or as soon thereafter as they could. Critically, it was added either that this syllable would occur only in words (specific condition) or that it could occur in both words and nonwords (nonspecific condition). Participants were asked to summarize the instructions, and the experimenter checked that they knew the target syllable, response key and the target context (i.e., word trials or word and nonword trials) before proceeding. A delay of approximately 5 min between PM instructions and the start of the PM block was created by asking participants to complete the Digit Symbol Substitution task and to fill in a demographic questionnaire. The procedure was similar for those in the control condition, except that they did not receive the PM instructions.</p>
<p align="left">The baseline and PM blocks each consisted of 252 lexical decision trials (126 words, 126 nonwords) with the six trials at the start of each block being buffer trials. The target syllable <italic>tor</italic> always occurred in a word and was presented eight times, once in each of the words <italic>dormitory</italic>, <italic>factory</italic>, <italic>history</italic>, <italic>torches</italic>, <italic>torment</italic>, <italic>tornado</italic>, <italic>tortoise</italic>, and <italic>victory</italic>. The order of appearance of these eight PM targets was randomized between participants; they were presented on Trials 31, 62, 93, 124, 155, 186, 217, and 248 of the PM block, resulting in PM targets being always 30 trials apart. Filler words for the LDT were generated from the <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Balota et al. (2007)</xref> English lexicon database. Words were four to nine letters in length, consisted of two to four syllables, and had a mean log-transformed hyperspace analogue to language frequency of 8.0. The <italic>tor</italic> words were matched with filler words on mean length, syllables, and frequency. Nonwords were also selected from <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-2" rid="c1">Balota et al. (2007)</xref> and were four to nine letters in length.</p>
<p align="left">All items appeared in lowercase letters and were presented at the center of the screen in 30-point font with a height corresponding to approximately a 1.3&#176; viewing angle at a distance of 50 cm. Each trial started with a 250-ms fixation cross, followed by the presentation of the letter string and finally the <italic>waiting</italic> message, the latter two presented until the participant responded or 4,000 ms had elapsed. At the end of the LDT, participants in the PM conditions answered a postexperiment questionnaire to check their memory for the PM task. They were asked to repeat the instructions for the second block of the LDT and all were able to correctly recall the corresponding PM instructions.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p align="left">For all analyses, the probability of a Type I error was set at .05. Estimates of effect size (&#951;<sub location="post" arrange="stack">p</sub><sup location="post" arrange="stack">2</sup>) for significant effects are reported. Four participants who were more than 2.5 standard deviations from their group&#8217;s mean response time (RT) in the LDT were removed, and excluding these data did not qualitatively change the results reported here.</p>
<sec id="s6" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Ongoing Task Performance</title>
<p align="left">Accuracy on the LDT was examined by including percentage correct in a 3 &#215; 2 &#215; 2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) with condition (control, specific, nonspecific) as the between-subjects factor, and block (baseline, PM) and trial type (word, nonword) as within-subjects factors. There was a main effect of trial type, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 12.40, <italic>MSE</italic> = 22.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, &#951;<sub location="post" arrange="stack">p</sub><sup location="post" arrange="stack">2</sup> = .11, such that accuracy was higher for words (95.7%) than for nonwords (94.1%). The only other significant effect was an interaction between condition and block, <italic>F</italic>(2, 98) = 3.17, <italic>MSE</italic> = 10.53, <italic>p</italic> = .047, &#951;<sub location="post" arrange="stack">p</sub><sup location="post" arrange="stack">2</sup> = .06. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-1" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, there was a decrease in accuracy from the baseline to the PM block in the nonspecific condition, <italic>t</italic>(37) = 3.14, <italic>p</italic> = .003, but not in the other two conditions (both <italic>t</italic>s &lt; 1).<xref ref-type="fn" id="fnc1-1" rid="fn1"><sup location="post">1</sup></xref><xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl1"/></p>
<p align="left">For RTs on the LDT, filler trials were trimmed to include only correct responses that were less than 2.5 standard deviations away from each participant&#8217;s mean (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-3" rid="c17">Knight et al., 2011</xref>). Trimming was done separately for the baseline and PM blocks and for word and nonword trials. The three filler trials immediately following each target were excluded to avoid potential bias from slowing associated with target-related processes. Trimming resulted in the elimination of 2.6% of correct RTs. Data were analyzed with a 3 &#215; 2 &#215; 2 ANOVA with condition (control, specific, nonspecific) as a between-subjects factor and block (baseline, PM) and trial type (word, nonword) as within-subjects factors. The three-way interaction was highly significant, <italic>F</italic>(2, 98) = 6.69, <italic>MSE</italic> = 3,548.90, <italic>p</italic> = .002, &#951;<sub location="post" arrange="stack">p</sub><sup location="post" arrange="stack">2</sup> = .12. Inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-1" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> suggests that this interaction was obtained because there was a practice effect from the baseline to the PM block in the control condition but a cost in the PM conditions, and cost was greater in the nonspecific condition than in the specific condition for nonwords but similar for words.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig1"/></p>
<p align="left">Next, to gain direct evidence for the different pattern of task interference between the specific and nonspecific conditions depending on the type of trial, a 3 &#215; 2 ANOVA with condition (control, specific, nonspecific) as a between-subjects factor and block (baseline, PM) as the within-subjects factor was conducted for word RTs. Results revealed a highly significant interaction, <italic>F</italic>(2, 98) = 31.50, <italic>MSE</italic> = 8,818.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, &#951;<sub location="post" arrange="stack">p</sub><sup location="post" arrange="stack">2</sup> = .39. A follow-up 2 &#215; 2 (Condition &#215; Block) ANOVA comparing the control and specific conditions showed that task interference was highly significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 61) = 44.15, <italic>MSE</italic> = 10,220.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, &#951;<sub location="post" arrange="stack">p</sub><sup location="post" arrange="stack">2</sup> = .42, for the interaction. That is, the difference between ongoing task RTs from the baseline to the PM block changed as a function of whether or not participants held an intention.

<p align="left">The 3 &#215; 2 ANOVA for nonword RTs also revealed a highly significant interaction, <italic>F</italic>(2, 98) = 25.58, <italic>MSE</italic> = 6,261.79, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, &#951;<sub location="post" arrange="stack">p</sub><sup location="post" arrange="stack">2</sup> = .34.

Thus, as expected, specifying the target context affected task interference in nonword trials, such that cost on these trials was reduced when the intention was associated with a specific context (i.e., word trials).</p>
<p align="left">To directly test that task interference in the specific condition changed on a trial-by-trial basis as a function of the relevance of the type of trial for the intention, we included RTs in the specific condition in a 2 &#215; 2 &#215; 2 ANOVA with condition (control, specific) as a between-subjects factor and block (baseline, PM) and trial type (word, nonword) as the within-subjects factors. Results revealed a significant three-way interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 61) = 10.34, <italic>MSE</italic> = 4,141.68, <italic>p</italic> = .002, &#951;<sub location="post" arrange="stack">p</sub><sup location="post" arrange="stack">2</sup> = .15. <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-2" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> suggests that this result was obtained because task interference (i.e., slowing from the baseline to the PM block in the specific relative to the control condition) was greater for words than for nonwords. Follow-up 2 &#215; 2 (Condition &#215; Trial Type) ANOVAs revealed that, as expected, for the baseline block, there was only a main effect of trial type, <italic>F</italic>(1, 61) = 9.01, <italic>MSE</italic> = 7,014.27, <italic>p</italic> = .004, &#951;<sub location="post" arrange="stack">p</sub><sup location="post" arrange="stack">2</sup> = .13, such that RTs were greater for nonwords than for words as is commonly found with LDTs (<italic>F</italic> &lt; 1 for the interaction).

Thus, these results clearly demonstrate that explicitly instructing participants about the specific ongoing task trials that were relevant for the PM task produced trial-by-trial changes in task interference as a function of the relevance of the type of trial for the intention.<xref ref-type="fn" id="fnc2-1" rid="fn2"><sup location="post">2</sup></xref></p>
<p align="left">Because the eight PM targets were consistently presented in word trials only, we were also interested in whether the pattern of task interference found for word and nonword trials remained constant throughout the course of the ongoing task. Did participants in the nonspecific condition develop awareness that targets were presented in only word trials, despite their expectation, and devote fewer resources to target detection in nonword trials as a result? We compared RTs in the two halves of the PM block (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-1" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" id="fnc3-1" rid="fn3"><sup location="post">3</sup></xref> A 3 &#215; 2 &#215; 2 ANOVA with condition (control, specific, nonspecific) as a between-subjects factor and trial type (word, nonword) and PM half (first, second) as the within-subjects factors revealed a main effect of PM half, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 56.64, <italic>MSE</italic> = 3,985.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, &#951;<sub location="post" arrange="stack">p</sub><sup location="post" arrange="stack">2</sup> = .37, as participants sped up from the first to the second half.

Thus, task interference was reduced from the first to the second half of the ongoing task and similarly so for the two PM conditions. It is interesting that there was no significant three-way interaction (<italic>p</italic> = .292), indicating that the pattern of costs with respect to words and nonwords did not change from the first to the second halves of the ongoing task.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl2"/></p>

<title>PM Performance</title>
<p align="left">A PM response was scored correct if the participant pressed the <italic>F6</italic> key during the target trial or within the next trial. Less than 1% of the PM responses occurred outside of these periods. We first examined overall PM performance. An independent samples <italic>t</italic> test showed that there was no difference in the percentage of targets detected between the specific (<italic>M</italic> = 78.1, <italic>SD</italic> = 26.5) and nonspecific (<italic>M =</italic> 77.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 25.1) conditions, <italic>t</italic>(72) &lt; 1. The observed levels of performance and the nonsignificant result are consistent with the results found for the LDT. Namely, the analyses reported above demonstrated that task interference was both significant and of similar magnitude for word trials (i.e., trials in which the PM targets always occurred) in the two PM conditions.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, because previous studies have shown that a decrease in ongoing task costs, as observed in the present study from the first to the second halves of the PM block, can be associated with reductions in PM performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-3" rid="c10">Einstein et al., 2005</xref>), we compared detection for Targets 1&#8211;4 with detection for Targets 5&#8211;8 (i.e., targets presented in each half of the PM block). The data were submitted to a 2 &#215; 2 ANOVA with condition (specific, nonspecific) as the between-subjects factor and target (first half, second half) as the within-subjects factor. There was only a main effect of target, such that PM performance declined from the first to the last four targets, <italic>F</italic>(1, 72) = 4.48, <italic>MSE</italic> = 493.02, <italic>p</italic> = .038, &#951;<sub location="post" arrange="stack">p</sub><sup location="post" arrange="stack">2</sup> = .06 (<italic>F</italic> &lt; 1 for the interaction).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p align="left">The results from this study show that associating a nonfocal PM task with a subset of ongoing task stimuli can reduce task interference for stimuli not linked to the intention. Moreover, although the explicit instruction that the nonfocal PM targets would occur only in a subset of stimuli led to a trial-by-trial reduction in task interference, it did not completely eliminate task interference for irrelevant nonword items, as revealed by comparison with a control condition that never received the PM instruction. It is important to note that the target context specification effect on task interference was observed even though trial presentation was random and not cued in any way. In addition, our results clearly demonstrate that participants can adjust their strategies in approaching the task in accordance with information about the specific ongoing trials where targets can occur and do so without compromising PM performance. This suggests that participants can engage monitoring processes more efficiently when given the chance to do so, such as when target context is clearly specified, as was done here.</p>
<p align="left">As noted in the introduction, the present manipulation of target context specification was not intended to distinguish between the PAM and multiprocess theories. Rather, we aimed to provide a more detailed examination of the processes contributing to task interference with nonfocal intentions. We observed trial-by-trial modulations in task interference as a function of stimulus relevance when the target context was specific, suggesting that monitoring processes can change flexibly. The PAM theory proposes that PM performance is determined by the interaction of preparatory and retrospective memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-3" rid="c39">Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-4" rid="c42">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). In its current formulation, recognition checks could account for the greater slowing for word trials relative to nonword trials found in the specific condition. Thus, preparatory attentional processes may serve the function of signaling relevant ongoing trials, such that once these trials are encountered, retrospective memory processes that allow for the discrimination between targets and nontargets can be engaged.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">Guynn (2003)</xref> proposed a two-process model of strategic monitoring comprising both a retrieval mode and item-checking processes. The first involves maintaining the intention in an increased state of activation and reflects the cognitive system&#8217;s readiness to perform the future action. By contrast, item checking is a more intermittent process that requires the allocation of attention to the context where the PM target can occur to verify whether stimuli meet the criteria for a PM response. The presence of task interference for nonword trials when participants were explicitly instructed that these were irrelevant for the intention (i.e., specific condition) is consistent with Guynn&#8217;s proposal that a retrieval mode is engaged across ongoing trials in preparation for the opportunity to execute the intention. Moreover, significant cost for irrelevant trials aligns well with evidence suggesting that maintenance of a retrieval mode is associated with increased activation in the frontal cortex and can rely on effortful processing as well as be affected by task switching (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">D&#252;zel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Jostmann &amp; Koole, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Morcom &amp; Rugg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Nyberg et al., 1995</xref>). In addition, we observed greater slowing for word trials than for irrelevant nonword trials when information about the local target context was available. This strongly suggests that additional processes, such as Guynn&#8217;s target checking, were recruited in the specific ongoing task trials that were relevant to the intention in order to support intention-related processing.<xref ref-type="fn" id="fnc4-1" rid="fn4"><sup location="post">4</sup></xref></p>
<p align="left">Considering the mechanisms that might underlie the present trial-by-trial modulations of task interference, one possibility is that the environment determines the allocation of attention to relevant ongoing stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-2" rid="c11">Guynn, 2003</xref>). This account seems unlikely, however, as capture of attention in a relatively automatic or reflexive stimulus-driven way has been associated with the presence of exogenous cues or salient stimuli (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Langton &amp; Bruce, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Mulckhuyse &amp; Theeuwes, 2010</xref>). Unlike previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-3" rid="c11">Guynn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-5" rid="c23">Marsh, Cook, &amp; Hicks, 2006</xref>), the nature of the upcoming trial was not cued in any way here, and relevant and irrelevant stimuli were perceptually similar and could be distinguished only on the basis of lexicality.</p>
<p align="left">Instead, the present results are more consistent with trial-by-trial changes in task interference as the result of top-down attentional control processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-4" rid="c11">Guynn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-2" rid="c16">Knight et al., 2010</xref>). In feature-based selective attention tasks, it has been proposed that a goal-directed attentional set is formed when one has knowledge in advance about the target-defining features. It is assumed that this set is involved in the top-down cognitive selection of stimuli and responses to reflect the individual&#8217;s expectations or goals and is associated with the recruitment of dorsal frontoparietal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Corbetta &amp; Shulman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-2" rid="c18">Langton &amp; Bruce, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-2" rid="c33">Mulckhuyse &amp; Theeuwes, 2010</xref>). In similar fashion, we propose that people will rely on available information about the target context (e.g., target-defining features, lexicality in the present study) to establish an attentional set at the outset of the task that combines ongoing and PM task representations. Attention allocated to ongoing task stimuli will therefore depend on the individual&#8217;s expectations or goals. In particular, top-down attention control will be exercised to modulate the deployment of attentional resources according to PM demands, such that additional attentional resources will be recruited to evaluate whether the stimulus is or is not a cue to perform the PM action when relevant, but not irrelevant, items are presented. However, when a distinction between relevant and irrelevant stimuli is not possible (e.g., when target context is not specified), the pattern of costs should resemble that found for the nonspecific condition. Nevertheless, under some circumstances, the allocation of attention might be at least partially stimulus driven (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-3" rid="c16">Knight et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Louren&#231;o &amp; Maylor, 2013</xref>). For example, target-defining features such as color might capture attention in an early stage of processing followed by a more top-down attentional control in accordance with the individual&#8217;s goals (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-3" rid="c33">Mulckhuyse &amp; Theeuwes, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-5" rid="c11">Guynn (2003)</xref>, Marsh and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">Hicks, Marsh, &amp; Cook, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-6" rid="c23">Marsh, Cook, &amp; Hicks, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Marsh, Hicks, &amp; Cook, 2005</xref>) also argued that attentional processes are dynamic. They assumed that participants establish a global attentional allocation policy at the outset of the ongoing task and that there can be local changes in task interference because of material-specific processing and of attention and effort naturally waxing and waning over the ongoing task as a result of irrelevant thoughts or interruptions. Accordingly, in the current study, it could be argued that ongoing stimuli that were initially classified as irrelevant for the PM task were processed more efficiently (i.e., quicker rejection of nonwords as targets). However, our results are at odds with <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-2" rid="c26">Marsh, Cook, and Hicks&#8217;s (2006)</xref> proposal that for item-level changes in task interference to be observed, participants must be able to predict the nature of the upcoming trial. Rather, such forewarning might be particularly crucial with paradigms that involve task switching between more than one type of ongoing task judgment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-3" rid="c26">Marsh, Cook, &amp; Hicks, 2006</xref>). For instance, cuing could allow selection of the appropriate response set, ensuring that top-down attentional control is exercised to modulate resource allocation according to PM demands and not, instead, to suppress irrelevant responses when the stimulus is presented.</p>
<p align="left">In the present study, specifying the target context at instructions reduced but did not completely eliminate the cost of holding a PM task for intention-irrelevant nonword trials. By contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-2" rid="c4">Cohen et al. (2012)</xref> found no significant cost for ongoing task trials that were not relevant to the intention. Accordingly, the authors proposed that participants were able to selectively attend to those stimuli that matched some of the PM targets&#8217; properties and filter out those that were not potential targets (stimulus-specific interference effect). However, across all three of Cohen et al.&#8217;s experiments, the difference was in the direction of such a cost for intention-irrelevant trials. It is possible that the failure to find significant task interference was due to insufficient statistical power. In addition, interpretation of findings is complicated by the fact that ongoing task accuracy was not reported and therefore a speed&#8211;accuracy trade-off cannot be ruled out (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-2" rid="c40">Smith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-5" rid="c42">Smith et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">As we used a demanding nonfocal PM task (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Meeks, Hicks, &amp; Marsh, 2007</xref>), one could also posit that the different outcomes between studies were due to the different PM tasks. However, there have been previous reports of significant ongoing task cost for nonwords under PM demands similar to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-3" rid="c4">Cohen et al. (2012</xref>; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-2" rid="c20">Loft &amp; Yeo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-4" rid="c39">Smith, 2003</xref>). Regardless, both studies clearly show that task interference can vary as a function of trial type when the nature of the upcoming stimulus cannot be predicted. They also suggest that trial-by-trial changes in task interference are not the sole result of the explicit or implicit nature of the PM task instructions. Still, it is possible that the capacity to spontaneously modulate the deployment of attention according to stimulus relevance to an intention varies between individuals and that, all experimental conditions being equal, providing explicit instructions reduces the variability of strategies used to approach the task (e.g., by providing a strong cue for how to flexibly allocate attention to minimize ongoing task interference).</p>
<p align="left">Of further interest in the present study was the pattern of task interference across the ongoing task, in that slowing for the PM conditions in comparison to the control was smaller in the second than in the first half of the PM block. This suggests that task interference decreased during the ongoing task and is line with previous findings showing that monitoring is a resource-demanding process that is difficult to sustain over extended periods of time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-4" rid="c10">Einstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-2" rid="c19">Loft et al., 2008</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" id="fnc5-1" rid="fn5"><sup location="post">5</sup></xref> Furthermore, regardless of the targets being consistently presented in word trials, there was no qualitative change in the relationship between task interference for words and nonwords across the ongoing task in the nonspecific condition. Because PM instructions explicitly stated that the targets could occur in both trials, perhaps participants developed an expectation that a target in a nonword trial would eventually be presented and/or that an earlier occurrence had simply been missed (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-3" rid="c19">Loft et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, results suggest that, at least with the number of target occurrences tested here, when participants are not warned that targets will always be presented in a subset of task stimuli, the representation of the target context is not updated to reflect experience with the PM targets&#8212;hence target checks will occur regardless of the ongoing trial type.</p>
<p align="left">Interesting avenues for future research may involve investigating item-level changes in task interference as they relate to individual differences in working memory. One possibility is that target context specification might compensate for PM deficits in low working memory participants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">Brewer, Knight, Marsh, &amp; Unsworth, 2010</xref>) by restricting the set of potential targets and promoting checking of intention-relevant items only. Alternatively, it is possible that the higher susceptibility of low working memory individuals to task-unrelated thoughts and impoverished ability to flexibly control attentional resources (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Kane et al., 2007</xref>) might interfere with their ability to modulate the deployment of attention. Regardless, extensions of the present results could have important implications for everyday cognitive performance.</p>
<p align="left">The present findings extend previous research in three ways. First, we manipulated participants&#8217; expectations about the target context at instructions. Moreover, unlike previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-4" rid="c4">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-7" rid="c23">Marsh, Cook, &amp; Hicks, 2006</xref>), the nature of our PM task (i.e., target syllable) meant that any ongoing task trial could be a potential target. Second, previous research has shown that ill-specified intentions carry greater cost to ongoing activities than do well-specified ones. However, specificity has been varied by having specific versus categorical targets (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-2" rid="c12">Hicks et al., 2005</xref>) or by associating the intention with a specific phase of the ongoing task (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Logie &amp; Maylor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-4" rid="c26">Marsh, Hicks, &amp; Cook, 2006</xref>). Here, we manipulated target context specification in a way that enabled relevant and irrelevant contexts to vary at random on a trial-by-trial basis within a single ongoing task. Third, we demonstrated that explicitly instructing participants that the nonfocal PM targets will occur only in a subset of stimuli can cause trial-by-trial reduction in task interference for intention-irrelevant items while leaving PM performance unaffected. This suggests that participants not only use their awareness of to-be-expected task demands to flexibly allocate attention but that they can do so efficiently.</p>

Given that PM performance was also reduced for the second half of the PM block and that previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-5" rid="c10">Einstein et al., 2005</xref>) has shown that engaging in costly monitoring processes is important for the detection of nonfocal targets, reduction of task interference seems more in line with our results.</p></fn>
