<abstract xml:lang="en">
<p align="left">Discomfort during interracial interactions is common among Whites in the U.S. and is linked to avoidance of interracial encounters. While the negative consequences of interracial discomfort are well-documented, understanding of its causes is still incomplete. Alcohol consumption has been shown to decrease negative emotions caused by self-presentational concern but increase negative emotions associated with racial prejudice. Using novel behavioral-expressive measures of emotion, we examined the impact of alcohol on displays of discomfort among 92 White individuals interacting in all-White or interracial groups. We used the Facial Action Coding System and comprehensive content-free speech analyses to examine affective and behavioral dynamics during these 36-min exchanges (7.9 million frames of video data). Among Whites consuming nonalcoholic beverages, those assigned to interracial groups evidenced more facial and speech displays of discomfort than those in all-White groups. In contrast, among intoxicated Whites there were no differences in displays of discomfort between interracial and all-White groups. Results highlight the central role of self-presentational concerns in interracial discomfort and offer new directions for applying theory and methods from emotion science to the examination of intergroup relations.</p>

<p align="left">Researchers have long been interested in understanding emotional responses to members of other racial groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Allport (1954)</xref> was among the first to emphasize the importance of emotions in interracial relations, writing in his seminal text, <italic>The Nature of Prejudice,</italic> &#8220;Defeated intellectually, prejudice lingers emotionally&#8221; (p. 328). Recent meta-analyses reveal that emotions toward minorities are twice as likely to predict behavior toward these groups as are cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1" rid="c50">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-1" rid="c74">Talaska, Fiske, &amp; Chaiken, 2008</xref>). In other words, aside from what people think, understanding how people feel about members of other racial groups may be key to understanding modern race relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1" rid="c44">Mackie, Smith, &amp; Ray, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">While &#8220;basic&#8221; emotions such as fear and disgust are widely held to characterize emotional responses to outgroup members, research suggests that interracial interactions are often marked by more subtle, blended emotions such as unease and discomfort.<xref ref-type="fn" id="fnc1-1" rid="fn1"><sup location="post">1</sup></xref> Interactions with individuals of another race are often stressful and both cognitively and emotionally taxing (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr76-1" rid="c76">Trawalter, Richeson, &amp; Shelton, 2009</xref>). Individuals experience increased physiological arousal during interracial interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1" rid="c46">Mendes, Major, McCoy, &amp; Blascovich, 2008</xref>) and show evidence of cognitive depletion following intergroup exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-1" rid="c59">Richeson &amp; Shelton, 2007</xref>). Discomfort experienced during interracial interactions is associated with avoidance of future interracial interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">Plant, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1" rid="c53">Plant &amp; Devine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr73-1" rid="c73">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 1985</xref>), and such avoidance can lead to serious negative consequences for race relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-2" rid="c1">Allport, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-2" rid="c50">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">While the negative consequences of interracial discomfort are well-documented, understanding of the causes of this discomfort in Whites is still incomplete. Theories of prejudice suggest that the negative affect experienced by Whites in interracial contexts is attributable directly to negative racial attitudes. Broadly speaking, such theories posit that the vast majority of White individuals in the U.S. are prejudiced against African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Crandall &amp; Eshleman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Devine, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 1986</xref>). Many theorists define this &#8220;unadulterated&#8221; prejudice as a negative affective state directed toward minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-2" rid="c9">Crandall &amp; Eshleman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-2" rid="c26">Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Katz &amp; Hass, 1988</xref>). Broadly termed &#8220;two-factor theories&#8221; by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-3" rid="c9">Crandall and Eshleman (2003)</xref>, these models propose that self-presentational concern serves to counteract or &#8220;hold in check&#8221; prejudicial emotion. While some theorists fail to identify which specific negative emotions are linked to unadulterated racial prejudice in Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-4" rid="c9">Crandall &amp; Eshleman, 2003</xref>), others specify negative emotions such as disgust, contempt, and fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, &amp; Xu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-3" rid="c26">Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 1986</xref>). Importantly, theorists further suggest that a general feeling of discomfort is characteristic of the prejudice of Whites against Blacks in the United States today (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">Dovidio &amp; Gaertner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Dovidio, Kawakami, &amp; Gaertner, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Dovidio, Kawakami, Johnson, Johnson, &amp; Howard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-2" rid="c23">Fiske et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-4" rid="c26">Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">More recently, researchers have identified presentational concern as a potential cause of interracial discomfort. Like the theories of prejudice outlined above, this research assumes that many Whites carefully monitor their behaviors during interracial interactions in order to avoid appearing racist (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1" rid="c47">Monteith, Deneen, &amp; Tooman, 1996</xref>). However, in contrast to two-factor theories of prejudice, which suggest that presentational concern decreases the expression of negative interracial emotions, this research suggests that presentational concern may actually induce negative emotions during interracial exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-1" rid="c52">Plant &amp; Butz, 2006</xref>). Studies have uncovered links between concern about appearing prejudiced and subsequent interracial anxiety, suggesting that behavioral manifestations of this anxiety may &#8220;leak&#8221; within the context of interracial interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-2" rid="c51">Plant, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-1" rid="c69">Shelton, West, &amp; Trail, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, investigators have hypothesized that presentational concerns disrupt natural, routinized behaviors in social interactions and that these disruptions may themselves breed further anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-1" rid="c49">Pearson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-2" rid="c59">Richeson &amp; Shelton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr78-1" rid="c78">Vorauer &amp; Turpie, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">While past research offers clues regarding the causes of interracial anxiety, this literature is largely composed of correlational studies testing the influence of racial attitudes and presentational concern separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-2" rid="c18">Dovidio et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-3" rid="c51">Plant, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-2" rid="c69">Shelton et al., 2010</xref>). Interpretation is complicated by the fact that prejudice and presentational concerns are theorized to operate nonindependently and may covary (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-5" rid="c9">Crandall &amp; Eshleman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-3" rid="c59">Richeson &amp; Shelton, 2007</xref>). Additional empirical research is required to understand the roles of prejudice and presentational concern in causing interracial anxiety.</p>

<title>Alcohol and Self-Presentation</title>
<p align="left">The impact of alcohol on interracial responding has bred interest among researchers and theorists studying intergroup relations. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-6" rid="c9">Crandall and Eshleman (2003)</xref> predict that alcohol consumption will decrease controlled self-monitoring, leading to increases in the expression of prejudice toward Blacks. Four empirical studies offer support for these predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Bartholow, Dickter, &amp; Sestir, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Bartholow, Henry, Lust, Saults, &amp; Wood, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-1" rid="c58">Reeves &amp; Nagoshi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-1" rid="c66">Schlauch, Lang, Plant, Christensen, &amp; Donohue, 2009</xref>). These studies indicate that the pharmacological effects of alcohol are associated with increases in race-biased errors on implicit associations tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-2" rid="c5">Bartholow et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-2" rid="c6">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-2" rid="c66">Schlauch et al., 2009</xref>) and increased self-reported anxiety following exposure to a racially charged film clip (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-2" rid="c58">Reeves &amp; Nagoshi, 1993</xref>). None of these studies examines behavior during interracial interactions, but instead examines behavior of participants in isolation responding to racial cues or &#8220;primes&#8221; (e.g., a black face on a screen).</p>
<p align="left">We believe it is important to examine the impact of alcohol on behavior in a social or &#8220;interactive&#8221; context. Research employing interactive paradigms suggests that manipulations designed to deplete cognitive resources actually decrease the expression of racial bias among Whites, suggesting that prior findings linking alcohol to increases in racial prejudice may not generalize to an interactive framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Mendes &amp; Koslov, 2012</xref>). Indeed, research suggests that response to alcohol differs dramatically between subjects drinking in social settings and those drinking in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">del Porto &amp; Masur, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Doty &amp; de Wit, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1" rid="c54">Pliner &amp; Cappell, 1974</xref>). Immediate, salient stimuli exert undue influence over the behavior of intoxicated individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-1" rid="c72">Steele &amp; Josephs, 1990</xref>) and, in the presence of such stimuli, intoxicated individuals can be induced to act in uncharacteristic ways (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">MacDonald, Fong, Zanna, &amp; Martineau, 2000</xref>). Research examining alcohol&#8217;s impact on racial attitudes has heretofore exposed participants to a single, immediate race cue. It is unclear whether such conditions mirror the complex social environments in which people typically drink and interact. Finally, research suggests that presentational concerns play a powerful role in determining affective and behavioral responding during interracial interactions. Such presentational concerns may not exert an equally strong influence on behavior among participants responding in isolation. An examination of alcohol&#8217;s impact on displays of discomfort during interracial interactions may help determine the role of presentational concerns in interracial discomfort.</p>
<p align="left">Alcohol is consumed across a broad range of social settings and represents a unique tool to examine the causes of interracial discomfort during social interactions. While alcohol is popularly believed to relieve stress, a large body of research indicates that the relationship between alcohol consumption and negative emotion varies depending on the source of discomfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-1" rid="c61">Sayette, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-2" rid="c72">Steele &amp; Josephs, 1990</xref>). Relevant to the present study are findings indicating that alcohol reliably decreases negative emotions attributable to self-presentational concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Hull, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">1987</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-2" rid="c32">Hull&#8217;s (1981)</xref> self-awareness model, alcohol pharmacologically reduces self-presentational discomfort by decreasing negative self-evaluation. If the source of anxiety extends beyond self-presentation, however, alcohol may in fact increase negative emotions. For example, when the direct cause of negative affect is present in the immediate environment, then discomfort can increase with alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-3" rid="c72">Steele &amp; Josephs, 1990</xref>). Furthermore, alcohol disinhibits the expression of feelings that are proscribed by societal norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-2" rid="c33">Hull, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-4" rid="c72">Steele &amp; Josephs, 1990</xref>). Thus, if discomfort is caused by prejudice against a fellow conversant in an interaction, alcohol may increase both the experience and expression of discomfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-3" rid="c58">Reeves &amp; Nagoshi, 1993</xref>). This study&#8212;the first to use an interracial social interaction to examine alcohol&#8217;s effects&#8212;may help disentangle discomfort attributable to underlying prejudice from that attributable to presentational concern.</p>

<title>Emotion Measurement</title>
<p align="left">An examination of the mechanisms supporting interracial anxiety presents methodological challenges related to the measurement of emotional experience. Indices of physiological arousal such as heart rate and galvanic skin response are lacking in emotional specificity. Self-reports require participants to aggregate subjective experiences over time, impose language on what may be a nonverbal experience, and may be vulnerable to distortions caused by self-presentational constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-1" rid="c68">Schwarz, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Social psychologists have recently called for research examining behavior directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Baumeister, Vohs, &amp; Funder, 2007</xref>), and advances in systems of measurement allow precise analysis of streams of ongoing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Bakeman, 1999</xref>). Research suggests that facial behavior effectively captures emotional experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Ekman &amp; Rosenberg, 1997</xref>). The present study is, to our knowledge, the first to use the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Ekman, Friesen, &amp; Hager, 2002</xref>) to examine emotional displays during interracial interactions. FACS represents the most comprehensive system for coding observable facial muscle movements, referred to as Action Units (AUs; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-2" rid="c21">Ekman et al., 2002</xref>). While previous studies examining facial expressions during interracial interactions have asked coders to make subjective judgments about the nature of behaviors (e.g., friendly, see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Dovidio, Hebl, Richeson, &amp; Shelton, 2006</xref>), FACS instead provides an objective anatomically based facial coding system (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Cohn &amp; Ekman, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Although labor intensive, FACS offers enhanced specificity and precision in the measurement of nonverbal behavior compared to other systems. For example, measuring nonverbal behaviors using a judgment-based approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-2" rid="c17">Dovidio and colleagues (2002)</xref> suggested that automatic attitudes were evident in nonverbal displays. While most facial actions are now believed to reflect a combination of automatically activated emotion and controlled monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Ekman, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Hess, Banse, &amp; Kappas, 1995</xref>), FACS allows researchers to differentiate those facial movements broadly associated with controlled processes from those more likely to be driven automatically. For example, FACS distinguishes &#8220;social smiles,&#8221; involving the movement of only the muscles around the mouth, from Duchenne or &#8220;felt&#8221; smiles, involving the simultaneous contraction of both mouth and eye muscles. FACS enables the detection of &#8220;microexpressions,&#8221; or expressions that appear on the face for less than a tenth of a second (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-2" rid="c22">Ekman &amp; Rosenberg, 1997</xref>), and has proven to be a valuable tool for detecting the emotions of individuals motivated to keep these emotions hidden (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Frank &amp; Ekman, 1997</xref>). Finally, FACS has proven to be a powerful predictor of behavior, over and above self-reported affect and observer judgments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Archinard, Haynal-Reymond, &amp; Heller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-3" rid="c22">Ekman &amp; Rosenberg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Gottman &amp; Levenson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Recently, applications of FACS have been expanded to enable measurement of subtler blended expressions related to emotions such as anxiety and discomfort. For instance, pressing or tightening of the lips has been associated with response to stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">Levenson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr65-1" rid="c65">Sayette, Smith, Breiner, &amp; Wilson, 1992</xref>), and lip pressing and tightening observed together with a smile (termed &#8220;smile controls&#8221;) are associated with discomfort attributable to controlled self-monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">Harris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Keltner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Keltner, Young, Heerey, Oemig, &amp; Monarch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-1" rid="c56">Reddy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-1" rid="c57">Reed, Sayette, &amp; Cohn, 2007</xref>). Most pertinent to the present study, smile controls are linked to embarrassment displays, or discomfort caused by negative self-evaluation following the violation of societal norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-2" rid="c35">Keltner, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">In addition to smile controls, which involve multiple facial actions, we assessed interracial discomfort using content-free speech coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Dabbs &amp; Ruback, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">1987</xref>). The relationship between speech latency (pauses) and anxiety is well documented, with longer speech latency being linked to state anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Harrigan, Wilson, &amp; Rosenthal, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-1" rid="c70">Siegman, 1987</xref>). Research and theory suggest that speech disfluencies and interruptions may be a defining characteristic of intergroup exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-7" rid="c9">Crandall &amp; Eshleman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr77-1" rid="c77">Vorauer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-1" rid="c79">Word, Zanna, &amp; Cooper, 1974</xref>). In our prior work, we have found pauses to provide a sensitive measure of discomfort across a range of populations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr80-1" rid="c80">Zlochower &amp; Cohn, 1996</xref>). In the present study, we use comprehensive, time-dependent coding of speech to investigate the role of pauses in interracial interactions.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p align="left">We examined nonverbal displays of discomfort among Whites in majority-White interracial groups&#8212;a previously unstudied phenomenon. Despite the frequent occurrence of majority-White group settings in the U.S., research to date has focused on interracial dyads (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr75-1" rid="c75">Toosi, Babbitt, Ambady, &amp; Sommers, 2012</xref>). Studies examining interracial groups have overwhelmingly emphasized the experience of &#8220;token&#8221; group members, or the individual whose social group is outnumbered in the exchange. This emphasis is partially attributable to research indicating that cognitive depletion measured following group interactions is more pronounced among &#8220;tokens&#8221; than those in the majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Lord &amp; Saenz, 1985</xref>). While research on &#8220;tokens&#8221; has produced valuable insights, study designs in this literature do not permit isolation of discomfort felt by those in the majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1" rid="c41">Levine &amp; Moreland, 1990</xref>). Even &#8220;subtle&#8221; manifestations of Whites&#8217; discomfort that &#8220;leak&#8221; through nonverbal channels negatively impact the experience of minorities and hurt race relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-2" rid="c49">Pearson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-2" rid="c79">Word et al., 1974</xref>). Our microanalytical system of contemporaneous behavioral measurement provides the power to detect these subtle but important manifestations of interracial discomfort.</p>
<p align="left">This study examined the behavior of Whites in an unstructured, lengthy (36-min) group exchange. Each three-person group consisted of two Whites interacting with a third group member who was either Black (interracial group) or White (all-White group). Our alcohol administration paradigm provided an ecologically valid tool to examine the extent to which interracial discomfort is attributable to presentational concern versus underlying racial prejudice.</p>
<p align="left">Consistent with prior research, we predicted that, among sober participants, there would be more behavioral-expressive display of discomfort in interracial than all-White groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr73-2" rid="c73">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 1985</xref>). Due to previously mentioned issues surrounding self-reported emotion measures, it was less clear that our self-report anxiety measure would produce a similar pattern of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-2" rid="c68">Schwarz, 1999</xref>). As suggested above, the impact of alcohol on behavioral-expressive display of discomfort should depend on the cause of interracial discomfort. If interracial discomfort were attributable to presentational concern, then alcohol should decrease displays of discomfort. If, however, this discomfort were attributable to underlying racial prejudice, then alcohol should increase displays of discomfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-8" rid="c9">Crandall &amp; Eshleman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-3" rid="c32">Hull, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-5" rid="c72">Steele &amp; Josephs, 1990</xref>). Racial prejudice could also manifest through increases in other negative affective displays and decreases in smiling with alcohol consumption. Discomfort attributable to a combination of presentational concern and racial prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr73-3" rid="c73">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 1985</xref>) would likely manifest as a weak or nonsignificant effect of alcohol on interracial discomfort.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p align="left">Participants were 138 individuals (90 female, 48 male) between the ages of 21 and 28 randomly assigned to 46 three-person groups. Participants were drawn from a parent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-1" rid="c62">Sayette, Creswell et al., 2012</xref>) examining the effect of alcohol consumption on social bonding. Half of the groups (23) contained one Black member and two White members; the 46 White members of these groups comprised the interracial group participants in the study. An additional 46 participants in 23 all-White groups were selected to match the White participants in interracial groups on gender and alcohol condition. Information from these 92 White participants is of primary interest in this study. However, the behaviors of the 46 Black or White &#8220;third group members&#8221; are accounted for in the analyses.</p>
<p align="left">Groups were randomly assigned to alcohol (told alcohol, receive alcohol), placebo (told alcohol, receive no-alcohol), or control (told no-alcohol, receive no-alcohol) conditions. To eliminate potential confounds created by cross-gender dynamics, participants from only same-gender groups were included. The study thus employed a 3 (Beverage Condition) &#215; 2 (Group Racial Composition) between-participants factorial design, generating the following conditions: Alcohol/All-White (<italic>n</italic> = 24), Alcohol/Interracial (<italic>n</italic> = 24), Placebo/All-White (<italic>n</italic> = 33), Placebo/Interracial (<italic>n</italic> = 33), Control/All-White (<italic>n</italic> = 12), Control/Interracial (<italic>n</italic> = 12). Participants were recruited via advertisements in local newspapers in the Pittsburgh area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p align="left">Participants who answered advertisements were informed that the purpose of the study was to measure alcohol&#8217;s impact on cognitive performance. When participants arrived in the lab, they were casually and individually introduced to confirm that they were not previously acquainted (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Kirchner, Sayette, Cohn, Moreland, &amp; Levine, 2006</xref>). Participants then provided a breath sample to assess blood alcohol content (BAC) and completed a variety of self-report mood and personality assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr71-1" rid="c71">Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, &amp; Jacobs, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">The three participants were then seated at equidistant intervals around a round table (75-cm diameter). Cameras were positioned in all four corners of the room, and a microphone recorded conversation. Participants were originally told that the cameras were being used to monitor their drink consumption and were later informed (see below) that the cameras also recorded facial expressions.</p>
<p align="left">Participants in the alcohol and placebo conditions were informed that they would be receiving alcohol and that the dose would be less than the legal driving limit. Drinks were mixed in front of all study groups to increase credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr60-1" rid="c60">Rohsenow &amp; Marlatt, 1981</xref>). As we have done previously (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-1" rid="c64">Sayette, Martin, Perrott, Wertz, &amp; Hufford, 2001</xref>), the alcoholic beverage was 1 part 100 proof vodka and 3.5 parts cranberry juice. In the placebo group, the glass was smeared with vodka, and a few drops of vodka were &#8220;floated&#8221; on the top of the beverage to enhance credibility. To adjust for gender effects, males in the alcohol condition were administered a .82<italic>g</italic>/kg dose of alcohol, while females were administered a .74<italic>g</italic>/kg dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-2" rid="c64">Sayette et al., 2001</xref>). To illustrate, a 170-lb man received the equivalent of about 7 oz of standard-issue 80 proof liquor, and a 130-lb female received 4.9 oz. Participants remained seated for a total of 36-min while beverages were administered in three equal parts at 0-min, 12-min, and 24-min. Participants were asked to drink their beverages evenly over the 12-min intervals and refrain from discussing how intoxicated they felt. Participants were otherwise not given instructions on whether to speak during the interaction period or what to talk about&#8212;participants were ostensibly seated in the same room to facilitate drink administration and communication with the experimenter.</p>
<p align="left">Following drinking, participants&#8217; BAC levels were recorded, and they again completed the STAI-B and performed some additional cognitive tasks (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-1" rid="c63">Sayette, Dimoff, Levine, Moreland, &amp; Votruba-Drzal, 2012</xref>). After BAC was again assessed, Placebo and Control participants were debriefed, paid $50, and allowed to leave. Participants in the alcohol condition remained until their BAC levels dropped below .025%. Before leaving, participants were informed that their behavior had been videotaped, and their consent to analyze the data was solicited (all participants agreed).</p>
<p align="left">Participants&#8217; facial expressions and speech during the drinking period were later coded by FACS-certified personnel using Observer Video-Pro software (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">Noldus Information Technology, 2010</xref>). The Observer system allows coders to time-stamp the start (onset) and stop (offset) of each AU to preserve the flow and synchrony of the interaction. Each frame (1/30th of a second) of the interaction was manually evaluated by coders for the presence or absence of relevant facial action units. All AUs were coded independently with the exception of AUs 23 and 24 (lip pressor and tightener), which were coded using the same identifier key. Video from each participant was independently coded so that the facial expressions of only one group member were visible to the coder at one time. Coders were blind to experimental condition.</p>

When smile controls were broadened to encompass not only AUs 23 and 24 but also AUs 14 and 15, reliability improved (<italic>k</italic> = .65). However, research suggests that AUs 14 and 15 accompanied by a smile do not reliably identify uncomfortable participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-3" rid="c35">Keltner, 1995</xref>). Therefore, primary analyses were conducted examining AUs 23 and 24 together with AU12 as a smile control and then confirmed using the merged AUs with higher kappas.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p align="left">Using novel procedures and observational measures, this study aimed to clarify the emotional experience of Whites interacting in interracial groups. Specifically, we examined the impact of alcohol on nonverbal displays of discomfort among Whites in interracial versus all-White groups. Results indicated that alcohol consumption reduced facial and verbal displays of discomfort associated with interracial interactions. Among sober participants, those assigned to interracial groups showed significantly more smile controls than those assigned to all-White groups. Additionally, the pause duration after the Black group member spoke was significantly longer in the sober interracial groups than the pause duration after a matched White group member spoke in all-White groups. Among intoxicated White participants there were no significant differences in smile controls or pause duration between interracial and all-White groups.</p>
<p align="left">Theories addressing alcohol&#8217;s impact on negative affect predict that alcohol will decrease discomfort attributable to presentational concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-5" rid="c32">Hull, 1981</xref>), but increase both the experience and the expression of negative affect associated with underlying racial prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-6" rid="c32">Hull, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-4" rid="c58">Reeves &amp; Nagoshi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-7" rid="c72">Steele &amp; Josephs, 1990</xref>). Alcohol eliminated displays of interracial discomfort among participants in our study, suggesting that the negative emotions of Whites in the present interracial groups were attributable to presentational concerns. Research indicates that presentational concerns lead to anxiety when the self is judged to have difficulty performing adequately in a social situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-7" rid="c32">Hull, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-1" rid="c67">Schlenker &amp; Leary, 1982</xref>). The smile control, a measure of discomfort employed in this study, has been associated with discomfort attributable to negative self-evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-4" rid="c35">Keltner, 1995</xref>). Thus, our study suggests that negative self-evaluation may at least partially underlie the link between presentational concerns and interracial discomfort.</p>
<p align="left">Furthermore, our group paradigm and behavioral measures offer insights regarding mechanisms by which discomfort and anxiety might be maintained and exacerbated within interracial interactions. For example, behavioral manifestations of discomfort may themselves foster further negative affect by disrupting social and affective flow during interactions. In addition, lengthening pause duration in interracial dyads may foster discomfort and engender the perception that one&#8217;s interaction partner is uninterested in the conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-3" rid="c49">Pearson et al., 2008</xref>). And smile controls, which work to counteract the smile, may interrupt the experience of positive emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-2" rid="c57">Reed et al., 2007</xref>). In sum, this study offers insight regarding those evaluative and behavioral mechanisms that may initially cause and then maintain discomfort during interracial interactions among some White individuals.</p>
<p align="left">It is important to note that negative interracial emotions (typically associated with prejudice) were not evident in our sample, as indicated by the fact that Whites in our interracial groups were not more likely to express negative AUs linked to emotions such as disgust, contempt, or fear than those in all-White groups regardless of alcohol condition. Furthermore, contrary to suggestions of some research and theory, we found no evidence that positive affective displays in interracial groups are more likely to be insincere (&#8220;social smiles&#8221;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-9" rid="c9">Crandall &amp; Eshleman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-3" rid="c17">Dovidio et al., 2002</xref>), and no evidence of differences in genuine or &#8220;Duchenne&#8221; smiling between Whites in interracial and all-White groups regardless of alcohol consumption. Thus, our findings using a group setting diverge from the findings of past studies exposing participants in isolation to &#8220;race cues&#8221; indicating that alcohol increases expressions of racial bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-3" rid="c5">Bartholow et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-5" rid="c58">Reeves &amp; Nagoshi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-3" rid="c66">Schlauch et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, our findings highlight the importance of interactive study designs in studying race relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Hebl &amp; Dovidio, 2005</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">LaPiere (1934)</xref> noted, responses to &#8220;symbolic&#8221; outgroup members are based only on group membership, while responses to a &#8220;flesh-and-blood&#8221; member of that same social category may be determined by a wide variety of factors other than racial attitudes.</p>
<p align="left">When combined with prior work linking presentational concern with interracial anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-4" rid="c51">Plant, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-2" rid="c52">Plant &amp; Butz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-3" rid="c69">Shelton et al., 2010</xref>), our findings may have implications for interventions designed to produce positive intergroup contact. They suggest, for example, that interventions that increase awareness of prejudice may have the negative consequence of heightening presentational concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-4" rid="c59">Richeson &amp; Shelton, 2007</xref>), thereby generating discomfort. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-5" rid="c59">Richeson and Shelton (2007)</xref> instead recommend interventions fostering a &#8220;promotion&#8221; focus, in which Whites are encouraged to seek positive intercultural experiences.</p>
<p align="left">It should be noted that our dependent measures of &#8220;discomfort&#8221; might also reflect controlled processing. Importantly, these perspectives need not be mutually exclusive, particularly in the context of a social interaction. Controlled processing may be stimulated by negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-3" rid="c6">Bartholow et al., 2012</xref>), and can be disruptive in the context of an interaction. Accordingly, research indicates that both smile controls and pauses reflect an aversive internal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-2" rid="c28">Harrigan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-5" rid="c35">Keltner, 1995</xref>) and are likely to be disruptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-4" rid="c49">Pearson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-3" rid="c57">Reed et al., 2007</xref>) during social exchange.</p>
<p align="left">Some limitations of this experiment should be mentioned. First, like most studies examining interracial interactions, we examined only one racial contrast&#8212;between the affective experience of Whites in majority-White interracial groups and all-White groups. Using microanalytical behavioral-expressive measures, we illustrate that even in majority-White social settings, Whites show evidence of interracial discomfort. Future research should examine the affective experience of Blacks in majority-Black interracial groups and all-Black groups, as well as the experience of the &#8220;third&#8221; (opposite-race) member in both majority-White and majority-Black interracial groups. Second, this study used an experimental environment devoid of explicit racial content or racial threat (e.g., we did not include measures of racial prejudice or mention race throughout the experiment, and the interracial interaction was framed as incidental to drink administration). Future studies should test the generalizability of our findings to racially charged social exchanges. Third, our measures of facial affect did not allow us to determine the direction of the emotional display. Thus, we were unable to determine whether emotional displays of Whites in our three-person interracial groups were directed toward Black or White group members. Fourth, consistent with our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-4" rid="c57">Reed et al., 2007</xref>), this study did not distinguish between smile controls that follow Duchenne smiles and those that follow &#8220;social smiles.&#8221; Finally, participants observed in this study were young and resided in a relatively diverse metropolitan area in the northeastern United States. It should be noted that two-factor theorists and those examining self-presentational concern have largely relied on samples of college students from similar geographical regions as in our study (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-4" rid="c17">Dovidio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-4" rid="c69">Shelton et al., 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, it would be valuable to determine whether results of this study generalize to Whites in other age groups and those residing in other areas of the country.</p>
<p align="left">In summary, this study used a novel experimental paradigm to assess the impact of alcohol on behaviorally expressed discomfort during intergroup interaction. Our results indicated that alcohol attenuated Whites&#8217; displays of interracial discomfort, highlighting the role of self-presentational concerns in negative intergroup emotions. In addition to shedding light on an important aspect of intergroup relations, the study demonstrates the utility of combining insights from multiple fields&#8212;in this case, alcohol administration research, social psychology, and emotion science&#8212;to better understand the effects of alcohol on social processes.</p>

<p align="left">FACS data were not coded from minutes 3&#8722;10 for 80% of third group members. Due to the time-consuming nature of FACS coding and the large study sample, the parent study focused on minutes 13&#8722;36 of the interaction, or the portion of the interaction during which the impact of alcohol on behavior was predicted to be the most pronounced (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-3" rid="c38">Kirchner et al., 2006</xref>). Minutes 3&#8722;10 were therefore not coded for the majority of participants (80%) in the parent study. For the current study we did code these missing minutes for our target White participants since we felt these complete trajectories over time would be of interest to researchers studying intergroup relations. However, since HLM has excellent properties for accounting for missing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-2" rid="c55">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>), we focused our coding efforts on target White participants.
