<p align="left">High profile crimes involving child sexual abuse in Canada and the United States has evoked shock and anger among community members. Sex offender registries (SORs) were created to provide police with an investigative tool to assist in solving sex crimes and increase public safety. There is no published research assessing sexual offenders&#8217; views about being on Canada&#8217;s two SORs. Ways that Canadian SORs could be improved to ensure maximum benefit to the public, the police, and registrants have never been investigated. In this study we collected sociodemographic information and used open-ended questionnaires to examine the accounts of 30 registered sex offenders with regard to their experiences of being a registrant on the National SOR and/or the Ontario SOR. Based on anecdotal reports of some registrants to the authors, it was hypothesised that sex offenders&#8217; opposition to SORs may be related primarily to the administration of conditions rather than specific features of the SOR. Results of this study indicated that the majority of registrants were not opposed to being on an SOR. Sixty-two percent of participants (13/21) felt that being on an SOR was not an onerous or intrusive experience. In fact 48% of participants (10/21) indicated registration was only a &#8220;minor irritant&#8221; or &#8220;slight inconvenience.&#8221; Furthermore, 66% of participants (15/22) on SORs felt they understand the rationale and the need for a properly utilized system of registration. More research needs to be completed on Canadian SORs so that researchers and criminal justice officials can have a more comprehensive understanding of the impact and outcomes of registration from the perspective of the registrants, law enforcement, and the community.</p>

<p align="left">Beginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a range of sexual offender policies were developed across North America in response to a series of publicized child sexual abuse crimes. These accounts elicited shock and anger amongst community members and catalyzed legislative innovation to provide more comprehensive state control over sexual offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Jenkins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Murphy, Fedoroff, &amp; Martineau, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Petrunik, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">In response to the emerging public perception of sexual offending as a serious social problem, legislation was enacted to create a comprehensive offender management system covering both incarceration and the post release period. Some mechanisms of control include: longer sentences, stricter limits on parole, intensive community supervision with orders restricting freedom of movement and association, sex offender registration, ankle bracelets, GPS monitors, and community notification (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Petrunik, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-2" rid="c24">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Petrunik, Murphy, &amp; Fedoroff, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Given research showing that rates of reported sex offences have been dropping over the past two decades, policies requiring more intensive sex offender management likely reflect media generated concern about the risk of sex offences rather than a response to published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">McAlinden, 2007</xref>). A reliance primarily on a combination of incarceration and surveillance is predicated on the arguably unproven hypothesis that sex offenders, as opposed to any other kind of offender, have a uniquely enduring predisposition to reoffend and, therefore, deserve to have their rights to privacy and freedom of movement severely limited in the interests of public safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Cole &amp; Petrunik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-2" rid="c19">McAlinden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Murphy, Brodsky et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Sex offender registries (SORs) are databases consisting of information about men and women convicted, or those found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (NCRMD), for a designated sex offence. Although details of registries can vary between jurisdictions and countries, the general process remains the same. Registries require offenders to register with the local police, provide personal details, and report any changes in the information presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Hudson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-3" rid="c19">McAlinden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-2" rid="c20">Murphy, Brodsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-2" rid="c23">Petrunik, 2003</xref>). A review of the literature indicates that there are two primary functions proposed by SOR advocates: SORs will assist in investigation of new sex crimes and SORs will serve to deter the commission of new sex offences (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Welchans, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">From a policing perspective, the rationale for SORs is to make information on sex offenders available to the police for more efficient identification and apprehension of suspects of new sexual offence cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Brodsky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-2" rid="c14">Hudson, 2005</xref>). Time is of the essence in responding to incidents of child abduction; therefore, having a database of known sex offenders can ostensibly assist investigators to identify or rule out potential suspects more efficiently based on characteristics such as the reported location of the abduction or abuse. Although there is no evidence at this point to clarify reasons for which being on a registry would be any more of a deterrent than being incarcerated, it could be assumed that SORs may have a deterrent effect by discouraging registrants from reoffending and would-be offenders from offending in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-2" rid="c5">Cole &amp; Petrunik, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-3" rid="c14">Hudson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-3" rid="c20">Murphy, Brodsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-2" rid="c21">Murphy, Fedoroff et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Canadian Context</title>
<p align="left">In Canada, the widely-publicized abduction, sexual assault, and murder of Christopher Stephenson by Joseph Fredericks in 1988 catalyzed Canadian legislative reform. This resulted in the creation and implementation of the Ontario Sex Offender Registry (OSOR) in 2001 and subsequently the National Sex Offender Registry (NSOR) in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-3" rid="c21">Murphy, Fedoroff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-3" rid="c23">Petrunik, 2003</xref>). Depending on what registry the offender is placed on, they are required to report for 10 years, 20 years, or life. Registration length is dependent on the number of criteria offences and the maximum sentence length.</p>
<p align="left">Criteria offences include, but are not limited to, sexual interference, invitation to sexual touching, sexual exploitation, incest, sexual assault, and creation, possession or distribution of child pornography (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Christopher&#8217;s Law, 2000</xref>). The list of designated offences for the OSOR and NSOR are generally the same; however, bestiality and voyeurism are designated offences under the OSOR but are not under the NSOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-2" rid="c4">Christopher&#8217;s Law, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">SOIRA, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">One of the driving forces behind the SOR legislation is the recognition of the importance of swift action during incidents of child abduction. As a result, police investigators can obtain support and access to the registry at all times. Investigators are able to, for example, search a geographical region based on the known location of an abduction or a sexual offence. The database generates a map and list of registrants within the given location to assist investigators in more efficiently identifying and ranking suspects for investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-4" rid="c21">Murphy, Fedoroff et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">However, investigators and law enforcement personnel are not permitted to disclose any information from the registry unless they are sharing it with other police forces for investigative purposes. This is because the registry is private and the information cannot be accessed by the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-3" rid="c4">Christopher&#8217;s Law, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-5" rid="c21">Murphy, Fedoroff et al., 2009</xref>). Canada has a system of public notification of the release of high risk offenders (including sex offenders); however, it is governed by provincial community safety legislation and is separate from the process of registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-2" rid="c25">Petrunik et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>American Context</title>
<p align="left">Most research on SORs involve offenders in the United States and typically includes information on demographic profiles of registrants, the accuracy of reported information, recidivism rates, and the hypothesised effects of registries (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Mustaine, Tewksbury, &amp; Stengel, 2006</xref>). Within the American context, few studies have been conducted that examine sex offenders&#8217; perceptions of registries (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Tewksbury, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Tewksbury &amp; Lees, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Tewksbury &amp; Zboga, 2010</xref>). Results of these studies identify the following collateral consequences of registration: increased difficulties obtaining employment, securing housing, financial loss, and being harassed or ostracized by community members. Additionally, registrants identified the process of notification as causing undue emotional burdens on the registrants&#8217; family and friends often resulting in the family cutting ties with the registrant (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Pogrebin, Dodge, &amp; Katsampes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-2" rid="c30">Tewksbury, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Zevitz &amp; Farkas, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Unlike Canada&#8217;s two registries, state registries and the national registry in the United States are open to the public. Legislation mandating registration also requires open access to SORs. This occurs primarily through searchable public Web sites, although information is also released through requests to law enforcement, media releases and (in some instances) court orders for the registrant to identify themselves in the community through flyers or signs (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-4" rid="c20">Murphy, Brodsky et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of SORs to increase investigative efficiency and deter first time offenders and/or sexual recidivists. To date, research has not positively demonstrated effectiveness of registration and notification as initially intended. Research results have been largely conflicting and ungeneralizable. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Zgoba, Witt, Dalessandro, and Veysey (2008)</xref> conducted a federally funded study in New Jersey examining the effectiveness of SORs and notification. Comparing rates before and after the implementation of registry legislation, results indicated that open registries had no significant effect on first time sexual offence rates, sexual recidivism, offence type, or number of victims. Given this lack of demonstrated effect, the authors questioned how justifiable it is to sustain such legislation given the increased cost of registry maintenance.</p>
<p align="left">Prescott and Rockoff (2008) note that due to public access of state and national registries, the majority of American research examines registration and notification as a single variable. The authors identify the need to separate notification from registration in order to understand the role of each in the community based management of sex offenders. Certainly this limits the generalizability of American findings to Canada and other countries with private registries. For a more comprehensive comparison of Canadian and American SORs see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-5" rid="c20">Murphy, Brodsky et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-6" rid="c21">Murphy, Fedoroff et al., 2009</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-3" rid="c25">Petrunik et al., 2008</xref>.</p>
<p align="left">Despite the clear focus of SORs on monitoring and regulating the actions of sexual offenders, there has been no research published that provides insight into sex offenders&#8217; perceptions and opinions about being on Canada&#8217;s Ontario SOR (OSOR) and/or National SOR (NSOR).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4">
<title>Research Questions</title>
<p align="left">A common assumption is that sex offenders would object to the use of SORs. However, sex offenders on Canadian SORs may be less opposed to the use of SORs than is generally assumed. In fact, some of these registrants have anecdotally described the process of registration as less onerous than it is to renew their driver&#8217;s licence. Furthermore, some say that being on the SOR has produced a decrease in the frequency with which they are interviewed by police during the investigation of new sexual offences; most likely because they can be more easily ruled out as a result of the information listed on the SOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-7" rid="c21">Murphy, Fedoroff et al., 2009</xref>). Of more importance, ways that Canadian SORs could be designed to ensure maximum benefit to the public, the police, and former sex offenders have never been investigated.</p>
<p align="left">The current study was designed to survey participants&#8217; views of SORs. Perceptions and experiences of the registrants are of particular interest to further improve risk management in the sexual offender population and generate recommendations for the improvement of Canada&#8217;s SORs. Given the difference in Canadian and American SORs, this study will provide insight into an unexplored area of community base management of sex offenders in Canadian.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p align="left">Thirty participants were included in the sample. The participants were adult males that appeared on the Ontario Sex Offender Registry, the National Sex Offender Registry, or both. See <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-1" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for a breakdown of the sociodemographic factors associated with the sample.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl1"/></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Materials</title>
<p align="left">Participants&#8217; perceptions were evaluated in a two-part questionnaire that took approximately one hour to complete. The first part of the questionnaire contained structured questions on the participant&#8217;s offence characteristics, as they pertained to the SOR, as well as questions to solicit sociodemographic information. Information pertaining to offence characteristics and registration included variables such as: which SOR they report to, length of reporting period, offence history, and compliance. The sociodemographic characteristics address self-report information pertaining to marital status, offspring, and housing.</p>
<p align="left">The second part of the questionnaire consisted of open-ended narrative style questions that specifically ask participants about what impact the SOR has had on them. The first set of variables examined is the extent to which offenders have disclosed their status as a registrant to others, what influenced their decision to disclose the information, and the reactions they observed. The second set of variables explores the impact that being a registrant has had within the following contexts: familial, social, work, education, and personal feelings of self-worth and autonomy. These social and personal variables were chosen as they would likely provide the most insight to the areas and extent to which SORs impact the participants.</p>
<p align="left">A related but independent area of examination includes the participants&#8217; experiences during police visits to their homes or workplaces. Lastly, in order to understand the level of knowledge that registrants have regarding the purpose and functions of the SOR, participants were asked about information they have been provided with regarding their SOR and their opinions about the areas of strength and weakness of their respective SOR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p align="left">Since the Ontario Sex Offender Registry and the National Sex Offender Registry are not open to the public, contact with registrants was made through the Sexual Behaviours Clinic (SBC) at the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre. The sample was recruited from outpatient&#8217;s receiving treatment in the form of group therapy and/or individual sessions with a forensic psychiatrist in the program. Recruitment began after appropriate ethical approval was obtained from the Institute of Mental Health Research&#8217;s Research Ethic Board.</p>
<p align="left">The requirements for eligibility were that the participants appear on either the Ontario Sex Offender Registry and/or the National Sex Offender Registry and can read and write in English at a minimum of a Grade 8 level. Although the SBC offers services in both French and English, the group therapy sessions from which the participants were recruited is composed of males who are either Anglophones or bilingual as group therapy sessions are conducted in English. As a result, being able to read and write in English was an inclusion requirement. Thirty participants were recruited for the study between August, 2008 and January, 2009.</p>
<p align="left">The potential participants were given an information sheet that provided an overview of the research study, the role of the participants, and the measures that were taken to ensure ethical standards were met. The consent form advised the participants of certain issues associated with involvement in the research study, such as potential risks, anonymity, confidentiality, data conservation, and voluntary participation. Approximately 50 to 60 potential participants were approached about the study. Thirty consented to involvement in the study and no participants subsequently revoked consent. The participants were debriefed on the intended use of the information and were provided with a list of contacts in the event that they experience any negative feelings as a result of participation in the study.</p>
<p align="left">Due to the sensitive nature of the registrant&#8217;s status as a sexual offender, maintaining confidentiality and anonymity were major concerns. Data related to this study, including all materials deriving from it, such as consent forms, are linked to a code for each participant. The code number that corresponds with each consent form allows for the data to be removed if a participant decides to withdraw from the study.</p>
<p align="left">The consent forms and the first part of the questionnaire were kept separate from the narrative section to ensure that the narratives cannot be linked to identifiable characteristics of the registrants. Furthermore, the sociodemographic and other characteristics of registrants were not referred to individually, but were rather examined as group data in order to provide a general overview of the registrants in the sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p align="left">The data were analysed in a manner that looked for general consensus, disagreement, or recurrent themes in the participant&#8217;s responses. Each narrative from the questionnaires was coded and examined by way of content analysis. Qualitative content analysis consists of procedural techniques for systematic text analysis. This approach was developed over 30 years ago on a study examining the psycho-social consequences of being unemployed and has since been used in many quantitative research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Mayring, 2000</xref>). Posing the questions in an open-ended narrative style allows for participants to produce a wide range of responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">Goodwin, 2005</xref>). This qualitative approach allowed for the analysis of trends within participants&#8217; experiences and perceptions, as well as any substantial differences that exist within the registrant&#8217;s written accounts. Where appropriate, narratives were either coded as positive, negative, or neutral and/or coded based on the themes of the answers. For example, when questioned about reasons for disclosing ones status as a registrant, the raters coded responses based on themes of the answers (honesty, access to family, support seeking, known due to charges). This permitted quantification for each theme by two separate raters. Cohen&#8217;s Kappa was calculated in order to determine interrater reliability between two raters. The results were strong with a Kappa of .89. According to Kappa standards established in <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Landis and Koch (1977)</xref> these results fall within the range of &#8220;almost perfect&#8221; (p. 165).</p>

<title>Disclosure of Status as Registrant and Perceived Responses</title>
<sec id="s12" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>To whom did they disclose?</title>
<p align="left">When participants were asked if they had disclosed to anyone that they were a registered sex offender on the OSOR or the NSOR, 91% (21/23) said that they had decided to tell a select number of people in their lives. Only two participants said they had not told anyone about their status on the registry.</p>
<p align="left">Of those who chose to disclose their status, family members and significant others were the ones most frequently confided in (14/23; 61%). However, many of these individuals were already aware of the sexual offence charges and, therefore, participants felt that it was not a hard decision to discuss being a registrant with their partner and more immediate family members. Six of 23 participants (26%) said they had discussed being on a SOR with close friends who they felt that they could trust with the information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s13" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>What reasons were cited for disclosing?</title>
<p align="left">The most commonly cited reason (11/21; 52%) for deciding to disclose their status to others was because they believed that they could trust these individuals with the information and felt that they needed to be honest with them. Thirty-three percent of the participants (7/21) noted that friends and family had already known about the sexual offence charges as the participant had told them about the charges prior to conviction or they had found out through other family, friends, or the media. In one case, family and friends had known because the participant had victimized a member of the family and the information came out when the victim came forward.</p>
<p align="left">Six of 21 participants (29%) reported that the reason for disclosing the information was because they had hoped to be able to seek support and/or encouragement during the trial. One registrant noted that he had also hoped to be able to obtain support from this loved ones during the time coming up to, and immediately after, the annual process of registration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s14" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>What were the perceived reactions of persons told about one&#8217;s registration?</title>
<p align="left">Ten of the 21 participant (48%) accounts revealed that many of the reactions of those they told were in response to the offence and the conviction as opposed to the information that the participant would be a registrant on a SOR. Four of 21 participants (19%) specifically discussed individuals&#8217; reactions to the participant&#8217;s placement on a SOR. Three of 21 participants (14%) revealed that they were often quite indifferent to the information. This is possibly because the information about the registry may have been overshadowed by the information about the offence and the conviction. Additionally, others may have anticipated that the participant would be placed on the registry as a response to their sex crimes.</p>
<p align="left">One participant confirmed this, saying that his family &#8220;understood why I had to be put on the registry and it doesn&#8217;t seem to be affecting them.&#8221; Another shared this: &#8220;Those who voiced an opinion suggested that I look at it as another tool to show everyone I have learned and understand my offence behaviour, lessening the chance of reoffending.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">However, one participant reported that his family was &#8220;upset&#8221; that he would have to register and receive annual visits from the police for an extended period of time. He reported that they were also upset about other conditions placed upon him, separate from the SOR, as they believed that the restrictions would make it more difficult for him to secure permanent employment.</p>

<title>Social and Personal Impact of SOR</title>
<sec id="s16" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Familial relationships</title>
<p align="left">As expected, reports revealed that the impact on familial relationships had more to do with the offence itself and various conditions of release from prison than issues stemming from being on a SOR. For example, four of the 21 participants (19%) stated that it became more difficult to spend time with younger family members, such as siblings, or family members who have young children, such as nieces or nephews. Another registrant revealed the added stress he feels around the holiday season as it is &#8220;hard to spend time with family on holidays due to younger children always being present.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">Three of 21 participants (14%) said they have not had any contact with their family members since they were charged and convicted. In some cases this was because their family members refused to see them. In another instance, the registrant cut off all contact with family because of &#8220;shame and fear of their reactions&#8221; and has &#8220;no plans to initiate contact.&#8221; Some of the participants also reported that there was a loss of trust as a result of their offences. One showed his eagerness to repair the relationships by explaining, &#8220;I have to earn their trust back and prove that I can be trusted again.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">Almost all statements (20/21; 95%) that referred specifically to the impact that registration had on their relationships with family members were neutral; saying that being on a registry had no real impact on their familial relationships. A frequent statement by participants was similar to &#8220;being on the registry itself has not had much of an impact on my family, whether I have told them or not&#8221;; another commented, &#8220;It was my offence that alienated them, not the registry.&#8221;</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s17" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Social life or attempts to form intimate relationships</title>
<p align="left">Thirty-seven percent of the participants (11/30) said that being on a registry had little or no impact on their overall social life or attempts to form intimate relationships. Of these individuals, many described themselves as being a &#8220;loner&#8221; and &#8220;not having much of a social life.&#8221; For others, the impact has been minimal and being a registrant &#8220;does not stop [them] from developing a social life.&#8221; Another acknowledged, &#8220;Some friends have turned their backs on me, but others have put the episode behind them.&#8221; However, this does not seem to bother him as he went on to explain that the registry has had &#8220;no real impact on my social life as my family has always been a focal point.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">Some participants (7/20; 35%) provided accounts on how their crimes and the resulting label as a &#8220;sex offender&#8221; has impacted their attempts to form relationships. One participant said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t form intimate relationships for fear of their reaction.&#8221; This fear was echoed by another who declared, &#8220;I have no plans to enter into such a relationship for fear of being rejected or being &#8216;outed.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">Another said that he struggled because he would like to form new relationships but felt &#8220;ashamed&#8221; of his crime. However, he also felt that if he is dishonest about his past and his current obligation to register then this will impact the level of intimacy he is able to achieve with another person. Similarly another explained that it is &#8220;difficult because although it is important for [your new partner] to know about you&#8221; making the decision to disclose the information is hard and &#8220;you never know how it will affect the relationship if the police show up&#8221; and you have not told them yet. Three registrants of 20 (15%) noted that events that arose from being on the registry, such as the annual drop-ins, could be easily explained away to partners, friends, or neighbours who do not know about the registrant&#8217;s status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s18" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Work life or career aspirations</title>
<p align="left">Eighty-three percent of the participants (15/18) noted that being on a registry did not have a significant impact their work life or general career goals. This is presumably the case because many of these individuals are retired or do not work because they are currently on Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP).</p>
<p align="left">Other participants provided examples in which attempts to obtain employment or the possibility for career advancement were impacted or feared to be impacted. One point raised by three of 18 participants (17%) was the fact that they had a criminal record and many jobs they wished to apply for required a criminal record check. One respondent explained this difficulty, &#8220;If a job advertisement states that they do criminal record checks then I would not apply, regardless of the position being advertised for. I feel that this has narrowed the pool of potential jobs and career paths.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">Six of 18 registrants (33%) indicated that they had not discussed their status as a registrant with their employer or coworkers. Three of 18 participants (16%) were concerned that somehow employers or coworkers would find out about their conviction, or status as a registrant, and react negatively. Concern was expressed by two of 18 participants (11%) that they may lose their jobs if the employer found out about their offence history. Three of 18 participants (16%) noted a concern that the police would show up at their work to check registry compliance and that coworkers and the employer would subsequently find out about his status. One participant revealed that he was &#8220;scared [the police] will come to my job looking for me if they can&#8217;t find me at home.&#8221; For another, his fear of being &#8220;found out&#8221; stopped him from taking promotions as he was concerned that having a high profile within the organisation put him more at risk for being found out.</p>
<p align="left">Feeling that they had to pass up opportunities for career advancement and for business travel was cited by two of 18 participants (11%). It is important to note that, at least for business travel, this has more to do with having a criminal record than being on a registry. This is because registrants only have to report travel if they will be away for seven days or more. In order for an offender who is on parole to travel over provincial or territorial boundaries within Canada, offenders require permission from their parole officer. Furthermore, in order for offenders to travel outside of the country there are special considerations. For example, to travel to the United States the offender is supposed to obtain a travel waiver (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Criminal Records Act, 1985</xref>), which may take time and can be somewhat costly. This has the effect of stopping some participants from seeking out or accepting opportunities to travel, thus potentially limiting their potential for career advancement.</p>

<title>Overall feelings of self worth and autonomy</title>
<p align="left">Participants were split with regard to the impact that being on a registry has had on their overall feelings of self worth and autonomy. For those who identified emotions in relation to the offence, the most common feelings were &#8220;shame,&#8221; &#8220;guilt,&#8221; and &#8220;self-hatred.&#8221; One of the study participants explained that it is not the registry that elicited these feelings but the offence itself.</p>
<p align="left">A few respondents (5/22; 23%) used words suggesting that being on a SOR was a validation of the status of sex offender as their &#8220;master status&#8221; (the primary social lens through which society views them; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">Hughes, 1945</xref>). For these individuals, they felt that the stigma attached to being a registered sex offender impeded their ability to move forward. However, it could also be argued that it is not so much their status as a registrant that elicits these feelings as much as their status as a &#8220;sex offender.&#8221; This can be seen by the comment of a participant who noted being identified as a sex offender &#8220;has left a stigma on me. A label that I carry with me and it never washes off.&#8221; Another provided insight into his struggle by noting the following:
<disp-quote>
<p align="left">I came forward with my offence of my own volition and served my sentence. The six years of not offending prior to my disclosure and arrest mean little now. Now I am judged by my crime first. There is blanket coverage of everyone.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p align="left">Throughout the questionnaire, many of the participants (9/30; 30%) explained that a lot of their feelings stemmed from the length of their reporting period. These feelings are articulated by a respondent who commented, &#8220;It makes me slow my healing process. I am constantly reminded that I am an offender when I actually <italic>was</italic> an offender. I am no longer offending but I am labeled for 20 years. This makes moving on complicated.&#8221; These feelings were echoed by many participants who struggled with the length of time they are required to report to the registry.</p>
<p align="left">Others reported limited or no negative feelings stemming from being on a SOR. The following comments demonstrate that, for some registrants, the impact has always been minimal: &#8220;Because the registry is private and none of my neighbours know, my self-esteem is fine&#8221;; &#8220;I just treat it as a necessary evil&#8221;; &#8220;It&#8217;s just a reminder that I am being watched&#8221;; and &#8220;Being on the SOR is not going to impact my self-worth. I will not let it lower my self-worth.&#8221; Three participants said with time they had learned to manage any negative feelings associated with being on a SOR.</p>

<title>The Policing Role</title>
<sec id="s21" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Overview of police visits</title>
<p align="left">Reports on the procedure during a police visit to ensure compliance were generally consistent. Typically, visits were conducted by two officers and lasted between five and 15 minutes. Participants reported on the general process and questions asked during annual drop-ins or during visits after registrants have changed residence. Questions that have been asked during the police visit include: if they have photo identification and proof of residency; with whom they live and if there are any children living in the residence; if they are complying with the conditions of the registry; and if they have any other conditions (such as parole conditions or a 161 prohibition order).</p>
<p align="left">Police also asked two of the 22 participants (9%) if they had access to the Internet. In one case the police required the individual to turn on his computer to prove that he did not have Internet access and that there was no child pornography on his computer. In the other case, the police officer went through all of his photo albums to see if he had any photos of children.</p>
<p align="left">There was some variation between how detailed the questions were as some reported that they simply had to show their photo identification. According to Sandra Wilson (personal communication, March 2009), the officer that was in charge of meeting with registrants for annual reregistration in the downtown Ottawa police detachment, this is part of random protocol. It is possible that officers who complete the drop-ins also contribute to this variation as they are permitted to question more thoroughly if the person they are visiting is under other conditions of release separate from the SOR, such as parole conditions.</p>
<p align="left">The general consensus about the officers&#8217; attitudes and demeanour was that they were polite and friendly. Five of 22 participants (23%) stated that as long as they were honest and compliant during the questioning the officers remained fairly professional.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s22" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Attempts to ensure privacy</title>
<p align="left">Eight of 20 respondents (40%) reported that the police visits were not much of a nuisance because the officers attempted to ensure their privacy wherever possible. Measures taken to ensure privacy included: showing up in an unmarked police car and wearing plain street clothes, or if they were dressed in uniform they were discreet when asking for the registrant, asking to come in the residence before they talked with the individual as opposed to asking questions outside their home or in the doorway, and making sure that the participant was alone or that those present knew about their status as a registrant prior to questioning him.</p>
<p align="left">However, some of the other participants did not have such experiences and provided accounts of how they felt the police acted in ways that did not respect the individual or did not attempt to ensure privacy. Of those that reported negative experiences during the police drop-ins, three of 20 participants (15%) explained that the police would begin asking them registry related questions where others might overhear and before they entered the residence. For example, there were incidents when the police were said to have stood in the doorway of the person&#8217;s residence or questioned them outside of their home where neighbours were able to witness the interaction.</p>
<p align="left">One respondent was concerned that his neighbours, who were not aware of his status as a registrant, would overhear the interaction. He recounted one visit during which two officers arrived in &#8220;uniform and a marked car&#8221; and began &#8220;asking questions immediately instead of coming inside first&#8230;making it look bad, as if I did something [new]&#8221;. He was concerned about the privacy of the visit as &#8220;the neighbours were staring over.&#8221; Similarly, concerns about privacy issues were raised by one study participant who recounted how in the lobby of his apartment building the police buzzed the intercom &#8220;and said they [were] there for the sex offender registry check.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">Another area of concern for participants was the wide variation in how &#8220;public&#8221; or &#8220;visible&#8221; the officers were when they arrived to check compliance. Officers could arrive in one or two marked police cruisers (sometimes with flashing lights) dressed in full uniform, in uniform but in an unmarked police car, in a marked cruiser but in plain street clothes, or in street clothes and an unmarked car.</p>

<title>Feelings of the Intrusiveness of Being on a SOR</title>
<p align="left">For the majority of the participants, feelings about the intrusiveness of being a registrant on a SOR are fairly limited. Thirteen of 21 participants (62%) reported sentiments that being a registrant was not an onerous or intrusive experience that negatively impacted their lives. Almost half (10/21; 48%) of these participants generally feel that although there are some limitations associated with being on a SOR, on the whole it is seen as only a &#8220;mild irritant&#8221; or &#8220;slight inconvenience.&#8221; One respondent illustrated this by saying, &#8220;It is not intrusive at all. One visit a year is no sweat! As long as they continue to be discreet!! If they remain discreet even four visits a year is not a problem.&#8221; The following types of statements were quite common responses and generally support this sentiment: &#8220;It limits my movement a little, but I only have to go to the police station once a year&#8221;; &#8220;It is not intrusive&#8230; the easiest part has always been the annual registration&#8221;; and &#8220;It has no real impact on my day to day life. Overall it is only a minor inconvenience.&#8221; Another explained how he rationalized the requirements for registration:
<disp-quote>
<p align="left">I chose to commit the crime; therefore I must live [with the consequences] as my victim does. For me it&#8217;s eight more years, for her, the rest of her life. I cannot argue with any intrusion within the specified period of time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p align="left">Of the participants that reported that there are parts of the registry that were more intrusive, the main concern centred on the annual police drop-ins. One participant stated that being a registrant is &#8220;not too intrusive. But it impacts me when you get close to registration time (depression) and when you wait for the visit after (anxiety).&#8221; Another provided this account, &#8220;Overall it is a minimal impact. But around registration time I feel it is more intrusive. It is stressful every year <italic>before</italic> they visit, but the actual visits are pretty uneventful and harmless.&#8221;</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s24" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Perceived Impact of SORs on Risk to Recidivate and Successful Community Reintegration</title>
<p align="left">More than half (14/21; 67%) of the participants said that they felt that being on a SOR has little or no impact on their ability to successfully reintegrate into the community. Some expressed sentiments that they had originally felt that being a registrant would make successful reintegration more difficult, but that over time they came to realise that this was not the case. One respondent noted, &#8220;Initially I was afraid people in my community would find out or question me as to why police were at my apartment. Over time I have realised that is not the case and the burden has decreased.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">Individuals who expressed concerns about their ability to successfully reintegrate generally centred around fear that community members would find out about their past conviction and status as a registered sex offender. One individual explained that he is afraid to move from his current residence as he is, &#8220;worried that the police will tell everyone if I move. I also don&#8217;t want my sister scrutinized.&#8221; In fact, according to current regulations, if a registrant moves and a public notification is subsequently made, such determinations only occur under provincial community safety legislation separate from the legislation governing SORs.</p>
<p align="left">Narratives describing the impact that being a registrant has on one&#8217;s propensity to sexually reoffend largely indicated that participants feel the registry did not have a negative impact on their risk level (20/23; 87%). This supports the findings of other research examining the impact of registration on recidivism or reconviction rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-4" rid="c14">Hudson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-3" rid="c30">Tewksbury, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">In fact, nine of 23 participants (39%) felt that being on a SOR acted as a deterrent to reoffending. One registrant explained, &#8220;It is a reminder or shot in the arm to keep clean.&#8221; Another said that it acted as a deterrent because he would not want his length of reporting to increase.</p>
<p align="left">One individual, who stated that the registry had no deterrent effect on his risk of reoffending suggested; &#8220;The SOR has nothing to do with my risk level. I will reoffend if I choose to and I will not reoffend if I choose not to.&#8221; A few participants (5/23; 22%) said that they will not reoffend regardless of the registry because they had established their own approach to ensuring that they would never recidivated. These individuals cited treatment, the community based organisation Circles of Support and Accountability (CoSA), and other stable social support systems as being much more likely to decrease their propensity to reoffend than being on a SOR. Other deterrents to recidivism cited include the desire to &#8220;live a normal life&#8221; and the negative experience of serving a jail term.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s25" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Moving Toward an Open Registry</title>
<p align="left">Interestingly, when asked if they would be deterred from recidivating if Canada&#8217;s registries were to become more like American SORs and were accessible to the public (either through Internet Web sites or upon citizens request to the police), participants opinions were divided. Thirty-three percent (7/21) of the respondents said that they would more likely be deterred from reoffending if the registry went public. One participant predicted that he &#8220;would not reoffend then for sure because it is publicly known and society would be constantly on watch.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">However, 64% (14/22) expressed strong feelings that if Canada&#8217;s SORs were to become accessible to the public then it would negatively affect their risk, making them more likely to recidivate. One participant said he felt that he would &#8220;be more likely to commit a crime if it was open to the public&#8221; as he would be &#8220;motivated by anger.&#8221; Another stated &#8220;if I were to be publicized or &#8216;outed&#8217; that would have a significant [negative] impact on my risk factors.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">Despite this general divide, 64% (14/22) of respondents expressed fears and concerns pertaining to the potential implications of having an open publicly accessible SOR. One individual stated, &#8220;I would be afraid to leave my apartment for fear of some type of vigilantism&#8230; that would make it near impossible to reoffend.&#8221; Fear of vigilante actions was a prominent concern among registrants. Some respondents expressed these sentiments about Canada opening SORs to the public: &#8220;It is a bad idea because it would encourage vigilantism&#8221;; &#8220;I see many chances for abuse to occur&#8221;; &#8220;That would be suicide for us&#8221;; &#8220;I would not commit another offence but I would live in fear all the time&#8221;; and &#8220;I would go underground if it was made public.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">Consistent with the earlier discussion on compliance rates in Canada versus the U.S. (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-6" rid="c20">Murphy, Brodsky et al., 2009</xref>), some participants indicated that they would feel the need to go underground to avoid vigilante action. Participants clearly demonstrated their concern and feelings about the impact that a SOR would have on the registrants if it were to be accessible by members of the public. One respondent provided his insight into this concern by saying:
<disp-quote>
<p align="left">If it was to happen it would drive sex offenders underground. Because if we are working to better ourselves and the public is allowed into our record to judge us we would not be safe and that would probably lead to more offending.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p align="left">This participant&#8217;s sentiment is supported by American research on registrants who have gone &#8220;underground&#8221; and were later charged with noncompliance of the registry. Findings indicated that they were more than two times more likely to sexually recidivate than registrants who were compliant with the SOR requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">Barnoski, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Registrants&#8217; Knowledge of the Purpose and Functions of the SORs</title>
<sec id="s27" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Understanding of rationale and the perceived &#8220;fairness&#8221; of registration</title>
<p align="left">More than two thirds (15/22; 66%) of the participants stated they understood the rationale underlying the use of the OSOR and the NSOR. However, although some claimed there was a &#8220;benefit of a properly utilized system of reference,&#8221; others expressed concern about the impact and effectiveness of a registry.</p>
<p align="left">Three of 22 respondents (14%) expressed concern about the selective use of registries for those who have committed sexual offences as opposed to other types of offences as well. They said that there should be a registry for other offenders who pose a risk to the community or who may have a similar or higher rate of recidivism. This sentiment has been cited by researchers as a criticism of current SORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-3" rid="c5">Cole &amp; Petrunik, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-2" rid="c6">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-7" rid="c20">Murphy, Brodsky et al., 2009</xref>). This concern was exemplified by one participant who stated, &#8220;No other type of criminal offence requires other people to register like this.&#8221; Another argued, &#8220;There should be a registry for murderers&#8221; or other violent offenders, such as men who have a history of physically assaulting women. One criticised the legislative requirements for being placed on an SOR, arguing that being placed on a registry for a first-time offence is not necessary and that an offender should only be required to register once he proved himself a recidivist by being convicted of a second sexual offence.</p>
<p align="left">One participant said he saw the registry as providing a &#8220;false sense of security [as] those that comply are not the problem.&#8221; This statement is based on the premise that it is the individuals who go underground and fail to adhere to the conditions of the registry that pose a higher risk of reoffending.</p>
<p align="left">Compared with some SORs in the U.S., Canada&#8217;s two registries have consistently maintained a high compliance rate of approximately 95% (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-8" rid="c20">Murphy, Brodsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-8" rid="c21">Murphy, Fedoroff et al., 2009</xref>). Presumably the concern on SOR noncompliance has more to do with registries that are open to the public than private SORs, such as the ones in Canada, which restrict the flow of information to the public.</p>
<p align="left">One participant commented that although he understands the rationale for registers, he supports treatment over registries because, &#8220;SORs do not address the original issue they were meant to resolve.&#8221; Attention should be drawn to the fact that from a policing perspective, the original intent of Canada&#8217;s SORs was to assist police in the investigations of crimes of a sexual nature. It should be noted there is no direct link between SORs and treatment, except for the possibly negative effect of encouraging men to &#8220;go underground&#8221; and drop out of treatment in order to avoid detection. Although deterrence may be an added benefit of registries, which has been suggested within some literature, it too remains separate from more therapeutic approaches.</p>
<p align="left">Others have taken this concept one step further and suggested that the funding that has been put into establishing and maintaining the NSOR and OSOR should be reallocated into sex offender treatment programs. As one respondent commented, &#8220;I understand that they want to keep an eye on us, but it doesn&#8217;t stop [sex offenders] from offending. They should take the money away from the registry and get more treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">All of the concerns described above were reiterated when participants were asked about whether they felt being placed on a SOR was a &#8220;fair&#8221; legal response to their sexual offence. Almost half of the respondents (12/26; 46%) said being required to register was a fair response to their crimes. However, six of these participants (23%) also raised concern about the length of time they were required to register. This was largely reported by participants who had been ordered to register for periods of 20 years or for life, as opposed to the minimum requirement of 10 years. Two of 26 respondents (8%) felt that being required to annually report for such an extended period of time was somewhat onerous and limited the participants&#8217; ability to fully move on from their offences.</p>

<title>Perceptions of strengths of SORs</title>
<p align="left">The positive themes noted with Canadian SORs included the point that annual registration requirements were not as bad as originally predicted. Another suggestion was that registrants were more easily ruled out of police investigations as a result of having their information on a registry.</p>
<p align="left">A significant characteristic of the NSOR and the OSOR was the privacy of the registries. Keeping these registries closed to the public was unanimously noted as a significant component in the participants&#8217; feelings of safety within the community and their compliancy with the registration requirements.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s30" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>SORs Versus Other Interventions</title>
<p align="left">When examining the perceived impact that SORs have on registrants, it is vital to ensure that experiences strictly pertaining to SORs are categorised and examined separately from experiences that are rooted within other conditions of release. Many of the negative experiences and associations made by participants referred to the impact of having a criminal record or other mechanisms of offender regulation. These may include 161 prohibition orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Criminal Code, 1985</xref>: s. 161.1) or restrictions placed on the offender through probation or parole. Limitations on international travel for work or restrictions prohibiting offenders from residing or visiting locations within the vicinity of children&#8217;s playgrounds are examples of frustrations cited by participants that arise from conditions that are separate from those required in Canada&#8217;s SORs. Research comparing the relative impact that various Canadian approaches to offender management pose for sex offenders helps identify sources of offender complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Rice, Murphy, &amp; Fedoroff, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s31" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Designated Officers and Consistent Training</title>
<p align="left">The majority of participants do not object to annual reregistration for SORs. This finding is consistent with other anecdotal reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-9" rid="c21">Murphy, Fedoroff et al., 2009</xref>) indicating that the process of registration is no more onerous than renewing a driver&#8217;s licence. By having a list of registered sex offenders, it is possible that registrants could be more readily ruled out of an investigation as a result of being on an SOR. For example, if a registrant does not meet the physical description of the suspect or does not live within a certain vicinity of the offence, then they could be ruled out as a potential suspect. Therefore, being on the SOR would lead to fewer knocks on their door by investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-10" rid="c21">Murphy, Fedoroff et al., 2009</xref>). This would likely be viewed as a benefit by the registrants and could be a possible &#8220;selling point&#8221; for registrants who are worried about the impact of being placed on a SOR. One concern with this rationale is that although SORs provide investigators with a list of previously convicted sex offenders, the most likely suspects in sex crimes are first time offenders because most men convicted of sex crimes never sexually reoffend (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Hanson &amp; Harris, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">In order to decrease registrants&#8217; concerns, consideration should be given to training specific officers to conduct the annual drop-ins (residency visits) and to monitor noncompliance. The training should include familiarity with community policing and mental health, especially concerning paraphilic sexual disorders. By designating the responsibility of drop-ins to select officers, over time there may be increased comfort on the part of the registrant and the officer alike. Increased familiarity may decrease registrants&#8217; anxiety while increasing the ability of the officers to note subtle changes. This knowledge may assist in preventing reoffence and aid more efficient exclusion of certain registrants from new sex crime investigations.</p>
<p align="left">Adequate and consistent training across jurisdictions about how to conduct compliance visits is of vital importance. A comprehensive report on the Ontario Sex Offender Registry (OSOR) by the <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Auditor General (2007)</xref> identified this as an area of concern. Not only did the report state that the OSOR Unit has limited influence with local police in terms of dealing with registry related issues, but it also stated that proper training and inspection of SOR use was not being conducted among police detachments. Annual or biannual training sessions for officers conducted by SOR personnel would help ensure that the drop-ins and investigations of noncompliance are being conducted properly and efficiently. This would also help to ensure that officers in different jurisdictions are all meeting uniform standards during the drop-ins. This type of training and procedural review is most important in jurisdictions that have a lower registry compliance rate.</p>
<p align="left">It is possible that proper training of officers who conduct compliance visits will have a positive impact on the already impressive compliance rate among Canadian registrants. This is supported by participant accounts where drop-in ratings were more likely to be neutral or positive when the police visits were conducted in a respectful manner and were similar from year to year. Additionally, these registrants reported decreased anxiety coming up to the next annual drop-in.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s32" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Consistency During &#8220;Drop-Ins&#8221;</title>
<p align="left">One of the few areas of concern for registrants was the inconsistent manner in which officers conducted the drop-ins; more specifically, the large variation in the appearance of the officers during the visits. Registrants who had experienced drop-ins in which the officers arrived in plain street clothes and an unmarked police car were much more likely to report that the visits went positively and reported less fear and anxiety for future police visits.</p>
<p align="left">The purpose of these police visits is to ensure that the SOR database is up-to-date and that registrants are in compliance with the terms of the SOR. In no way are registries and police drop-ins intended to be additional punishment for the registrant&#8217;s past offences as this would go against the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws and double jeopardy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-9" rid="c20">Murphy, Brodsky et al., 2009</xref>). As a result there is no justification for officers to bring undue attention to the registrant during visits because there is no increase to overall public safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-4" rid="c25">Petrunik et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">However, some complaints came from participants who said the officers were not acting discreetly during the drop-in visit. For example, arriving in a marked police car with the lights turned on in the participant&#8217;s driveway and conducting the visit at the front door is stigmatizing and unnecessary. In fact, police behaviours that increase the likelihood of neighbours or associates discovering the registrant&#8217;s status as a sex offender can have significant implications. It can lead to harassment by community members and can lead to the registrant experiencing increased anxiety and subsequently going &#8220;underground.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">Registrants from this study clearly stated that they considered officers who showed up in plain clothes to be much more &#8220;personable.&#8221; They were more likely to report limited or no concern about future police drop-ins. It is, therefore, recommended that police detachments consider adopting polices to encourage or require officers engaged in drop-ins to take measures to avoid drawing attention to the registrant, such as wearing plain clothes and arriving in unmarked cars.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s33" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Length of Reporting Period</title>
<p align="left">Currently the NSOR requires registrants to report for a period of 10 years, 20 years, or life and the OSOR has reporting periods of either 10 years or life. Once placed on an SOR, registrants report annually, when there is a change in their address, or go on extended travel. This requirement remains regardless of the time served on the SOR or the offender&#8217;s estimated risk of recidivism. Although many registrants from this sample did not find the annual requirement to register onerous, some complained about the extended length of time they were required to report. This was noted particularly among participants who were required to report for 20 years or life.</p>
<p align="left">A meta-analysis conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-2" rid="c13">Harris and Hanson (2004)</xref> provided data concerning the relative recidivism rates among categories of sexual offenders and the survival curves for 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years at risk. Recidivism in these studies was measured by a combination of arrests and convictions. Over time, recidivism rates among sex offenders decreased in frequency. With different types of sex offenders grouped together, the sexual recidivism rates were 14% after 5 years, 20% after 10 years, and 24% after 15 years, cumulatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-3" rid="c13">Harris &amp; Hanson, 2004</xref>). The authors concluded that &#8220;without exception, the longer offenders remain offence-free in the community the less likely they are to sexually recidivate&#8221; (p. 7). They explained that, &#8220;The highest risk period is in the first few years after release&#8221; (p. 7). There are no peer reviewed articles that refute this claim.</p>
<p align="left">Based on the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-4" rid="c13">Harris and Hanson (2004)</xref>, having more intensive management and more up-to-date offender information would be of increased value during the first 5 years after the offender is released because most men who reoffend do so within the first year of release to the community and the likelihood of reoffence decreases for every year an individual does not reoffend. After 15 years without reoffending, the registrant&#8217;s risk of sexually reoffending is substantially reduced.</p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Bonta and Andrews&#8217; (2007)</xref> Risk-Need-Responsively Model (RNR) provides perspective into a widely used approach to offender assessment and rehabilitation. One of the underlying components for this model is the &#8220;Risk principle&#8221; that calls for criminal justice officials to match the level and intensity of the service to the offender&#8217;s risk to reoffend. Although arguments can be made to keep registrants&#8217; past information on the database indefinitely, based on the logic of the sex offender recidivism survival curve and the Risk principle, it seems reasonable to scale down the level of supervision and lengthen time between reporting periods after the first 5 to 10 years in the community without recidivism. Based on the RNR principle, registrants may benefit more from frequent contact during the first years of return to the community but less frequent contact over time. This would allocate resources for system maintenance more efficiently, and possibly decrease registrants&#8217; feelings of not being able to fully move on from the offence.</p>
<p align="left">Another option for registrants who are on the NSOR and object to the length of the reporting period would be to apply for a &#8220;termination order&#8221; after the required time has passed. A termination order ends the reporting requirement but the registrant&#8217;s information remains in the database indefinitely in the event that the information is needed in a new investigation. If the court determines that continued registration is grossly disproportionate to the interest of the public, then a termination order can be granted and the individual would not be required to register (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-2" rid="c29">SOIRA, 2004</xref>). Similar to suggestions made by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-5" rid="c13">Harris and Hanson (2004)</xref>, this process seems to work on the premise that after a suitable amount of time has been served on the SOR, the registrant will pose less of a risk and, therefore, no longer need to register. Registrants on the OSOR do not have a termination option under the current legislation.</p>

<title>Specific Determinations of Risk Levels</title>
<p align="left">Something that may work to improve the efficiency of police investigations during crimes of a sexual nature is if the database contained an estimation of registrants&#8217; relative risk to recidivate. This will also help to further reduce the number of times that a registrant receives a &#8220;door-knock&#8221; during police investigations of sex crimes. Currently, investigators are able to search the database for specific criteria such as appearance, offence type, location, and so on. However, when investigators receive the list of registrants who match their search criteria they are limited in their ability to prioritize the registrants based on the level of risk since this information is not currently available.</p>
<p align="left">An easily scored risk assessment tool with objective criteria, such as the Static-99R, could provide beneficial information to the investigators. The Static-99R (see static99.org) is an actuarial risk assessment tool that was designed to assess risk of violent and sexual recidivism among sexual offender populations. It is designed to predict long-term risk potential among convicted adult male sex offenders. The tool is comprised of 10 static variables assessed through file information. An individual&#8217;s score can range from 0&#8211;6+; 0 being low risk and 6+ being the highest risk. The final interpretation of the risk level allows for minimal subjective input given the level of standardization in the Static 99R (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Craissati, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">Hanson &amp; Thornton, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Actuarial risk assessment tools, like the Static 99R, can help to categorise the relative risk levels for registrants on the OSOR and NSOR. By utilizing this risk assessment tool among registrants, investigators will be able to identifying and categorise low risk offenders separately from high risk offenders. As a result, investigators will be able to more efficiently prioritize suspects during investigations for sex crimes. In addition to more effective prioritization, this will reduce any concerns that registrants may have about unnecessary &#8220;door knocks&#8221; for low risk registrants during sex crime investigations. Furthermore, it would also be possible for risk determinations to assist in deciding how frequently registrants should be required to report and how many police drop-ins to ensure compliance are required throughout the year. Proper utilization of actuarial risk assessments could make significant contributions to the way the OSOR and NSOR assist sex crime investigations.</p>

<title>Cost-Benefit Analysis</title>
<p align="left">Attempts to maintain a balance between the offenders&#8217; rights to freedom and privacy within the overall protection of the public can be difficult when dealing with a subgroup of offenders who are viewed as dangerous and &#8220;morally tainted.&#8221; Legislation for SORs and separate policies that govern community notification practices are meant to aid law enforcement officials during investigations of child abduction and sexual abuse, while also increasing community safety by preventing sex offender recidivism. To the public, SORs are actions taken to protect the public from sexual victimization.</p>
<p align="left">However, the relative utility of such mechanisms of control have yet to be demonstrated. Prospective studies are needed to show the relative impact that Canada&#8217;s two SORs have on offenders&#8217; propensity to reoffend, the efficiency of investigations into sex crimes, and the impact on public safety. For example, if registries perform the way they are intended, there should be a decrease in the time it takes for investigators to successfully apprehend sex offenders who are on SORs. In addition, there might be a decrease in sexual recidivism among registrants. However, research has yet to establish the impact that SORs have had on these rates. Demonstrating whether or not the initial objectives of SORs have been met would support their continued use. The consistent application and effective enforcement of registry legislation, offender compliance and the monetary requirements for successful maintenance of these SORs should also be evaluated.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p align="left">Although this study is useful in that it provides information about an area that has received little research attention in Canada, the qualitative study has a relatively small sample size and should be regarded as exploratory. Additionally, not all participants chose to provide responses to every single question and this may have resulted in a selective report of reactions. Future collaborations with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police&#8217;s Behavioural Sciences Branch and the Ontario Provincial Police&#8217;s Behavioural Sciences and Analysis Unit would allow for more comprehensive research on a larger sample of registrants from the NSOR and OSOR.</p>
<p align="left">Access to this sample has been obtained through the SBC at the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre from particular group intervention program and may not be representative of registrants pursuing other&#8212;or not currently pursuing treatment interventions. It is also possible that participants receiving therapy interventions may have a more favourable view of law enforcement as a result of the therapy itself, or as a result of self-selection into therapy. In addition, although participants were assured their responses were anonymous and would not affect treatment in any way, this may have influenced responses.</p>
<p align="left">There are some limitations to the external validity of the research. First, the sample being used is only representative of the registrants from the Ottawa and surrounding area and the findings cannot be generalised on a provincial or national level. This potential threat to generalizability is somewhat limited however, because the SBC accepts a wide range of referrals from Eastern Ontario and there are virtually no exclusion criteria for entry into the clinic aside from willingness to participate. Patients of the SBC include individuals who have never committed an offence and individuals at all stages in the criminal justice system. Additionally the only criteria for involvement in the study were being on either the OSOR or NSOR and being able to read and write English at a Grade 8 level. Given that research on Canadian registries is in its infancy, the sample will provide initial information on a population that not yet received systematic research attention.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p align="left">This article describes a qualitative investigation of the self-reported perceptions and experiences of a sample of registrants on the Ontario and/or National SORs. The perceived impact of registration on relationships (familial, social, and intimate) and vocational or educational goals were examined; as were themes regarding police drop-ins and overall impact of registration. Registrants reported surprisingly positive reactions to the process of registration but questioned some of the monitoring practices. The negative impact of the SORs is limited but exacerbated by some police monitoring and criminal justice interventions unrelated to the SORs. Many registrants understood the need for a properly utilized system of registration and noted that being on a SOR reduced contact with police on unrelated cases because they could be &#8220;ruled out&#8221; more quickly hence reassuring registrants who are not recidivists.</p>
<p align="left">Potential alternatives to current &#8220;Best Practice&#8221; approaches have been explored with the intention of ensuring maximum benefit to overall public safety, sex crime investigations, and registrants alike. More research needs to be completed on SORs from the Canadian perspective so that researchers and criminal justice officials can have a more comprehensive understanding of Canadian registrants as opposed to relying on ungeneralizable research findings based solely on the American system.</p>
