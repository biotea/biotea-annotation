<p align="left">Despite myriad possible differences in perspectives brought to an investigative interview by eyewitnesses and interviewers, little is known about how such differences might affect eyewitness memory reports or interviewer behavior. Two experiments tested the impact of such differences in a dynamic interaction paradigm in which participants served as eyewitnesses and interviewers. In Experiment 1 (<italic>N</italic> = 38 pairs), reporting goals for eyewitnesses and interviewers were manipulated in a factorial design, with participants instructed to provide or obtain either as much information as possible or only accurate information. Matching interviewer&#8722;interviewee instructions promoted accurate reporting, regardless of the actual content of the instructions. In Experiment 2 (<italic>N</italic> = 45 pairs), access to information about corroborating eyewitness identifications was manipulated in a factorial design. Corroborating information affected interviewers, but not eyewitnesses. When interviewers did not have access to corroborating information, they provided more negative feedback, and there was a trend toward interrupting more and asking more yes/no questions. These experiments indicate that differences in perspective can have effects on both the content of a witness&#8217;s report and the behavior of an interviewer. The potential for differences in perspective should be considered in research on protocols intended to maximize eyewitness report accuracy.</p>

<sec id="s1">
<p align="left">When investigating a crime, forensic interviewers rely on witnesses for information about how the crime unfolded, descriptions of the culprit, and, often, identifying the culprit. This information shapes the nascent investigation in important ways, sometimes directing it toward innocent suspects. For example, DNA exoneree James Bain was first implicated because the victim&#8217;s description of the perpetrator &#8220;sounded like&#8221; him (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Innocence Project, n.d.</xref>). Just as eyewitness reports can spontaneously misdirect an investigation, police can collect erroneous information from eyewitnesses through flawed interview techniques. The recognition of how interviewers can negatively affect the content of witness reports has stimulated research on protocols designed to maximize eyewitness accuracy (e.g., the Cognitive Interview; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Geiselman et al., 1984</xref>). Although these protocols have been responsible for significant improvements in police interviewing methods, they ignore the potential for preinterview differences in interviewer&#8722;interviewee perspective to alter either the eyewitness&#8217;s report or the interviewer&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<p align="left">In the current research, we examined differences in preinterview goals (Experiment 1) and access to evidence (Experiment 2). Differences in both goals and access to evidence are likely features of investigative interviews. For example, an interviewer might rush through instructions during a crime scene interview, failing to explain that he or she wants all details recalled (i.e., the &#8220;report everything&#8221; component of the Cognitive Interview; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-2" rid="c14">Geiselman et al., 1984</xref>). Without that explicit guidance, an eyewitness might report only those details recalled with high confidence, potentially omitting crucial details from the report (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-1" rid="c59">Yaniv &amp; Foster, 1995</xref>). In terms of preinterview differences in access to evidence, interviewers typically have information unavailable to eyewitnesses (e.g., knowledge about another witness&#8217;s identification). In other cases, discussions between cowitnesses might mean that an eyewitness has information unavailable to an interviewer (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1" rid="c44">Skagerberg &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Differences in preinterview variables are important because they have the potential to create differences in how the eyewitness and the interviewer approach the interview. At this point, we do not know how any differences will affect the interviewer&#8217;s behavior and/or the quality or quantity of details obtained from the eyewitness. To examine the effect of differences in preinterview variables on eyewitness reports and interviewer behavior, we created a dynamic interview paradigm in which one of each pair of participants served as the interviewer and the other as the eyewitness. Before describing our experiments in detail, we briefly review relevant literature.</p>

<title>Investigative Interviews</title>
<p align="left">Eyewitness interviews often contain a number of undesirable practices, such as asking leading or suggestive questions, interrupting witnesses, and discouraging witnesses from offering any information not directly related to a given question (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">Snook &amp; Keating, 2011</xref>). For example, although training cautions interviewers against using closed questions, field studies have indicated that interviewers routinely violate this guideline, with as many as 34.5% of questions classified as closed rather than open-ended (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-2" rid="c48">Snook &amp; Keating, 2011</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Clarke &amp; Milne, 2001</xref>). Other field studies have shown that, on average, experienced interviewers interrupt witnesses 7.5 s after an interview begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">Fisher, Geiselman, Raymond, Jurkevich, &amp; Warhaftig, 1987</xref>). More recently, a sample of 26 experienced detectives ignored key features of effective interviewing, preferring closed questions to open ones, interrupting witnesses, and even insulting them during the course of the interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Schreiber Compo, Gregory, &amp; Fisher, 2010</xref>). These practices decrease both the amount and the accuracy of information provided by witnesses.</p>
<p align="left">These undesirable practices occur in part because many professional interviewers receive only brief training on how to conduct interviews with eyewitnesses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1" rid="c47">Snook, Eastwood, Stinson, Tedeschini, &amp; House, 2010</xref>). When interviewers are trained, the preferred protocol is the Cognitive Interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Fisher &amp; Geiselman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-3" rid="c14">Geiselman et al., 1984</xref>). This protocol instructs interviewers to guide witnesses through four processes: mental reinstatement of context, the recall of the maximum possible amount of information, changing the order of narration, and retelling the scene from an alternative perspective (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Memon, Meissner, &amp; Fraser, 2010</xref>, for a meta-analysis). Several decades of research have confirmed that interviewers trained with the Cognitive Interview outperform untrained interviewers, as measured by the amount of accurate information collected from witnesses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-2" rid="c32">Memon et al., 2010</xref>). Even though the Cognitive Interview has clear benefits, some trained interviewers fail to follow established protocols if time has elapsed since training (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1" rid="c46">Smith, Powell, &amp; Lum, 2009</xref>) or because they are not convinced that the techniques are effective (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-1" rid="c57">Wells, Memon, &amp; Penrod, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p align="left">Investigative interview protocols do not account for varying expectations that might be brought to an interview by either interviewers or eyewitnesses. In our first experiment, we focused on how differences in expectations can shape an investigative interview. Before describing specific predictions in the context of an eyewitness interview, we briefly review relevant data on expectations more broadly, all of which demonstrate the clear role of expectations in shaping behavior. First, at a basic social level, people who expect interaction partners to be sociable find evidence to confirm that expectation in a brief conversation. Even more striking is that independent observers actually rate the interaction partners as more sociable (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-1" rid="c49">Snyder, Tanke, &amp; Berscheid, 1977</xref>). The same pattern appears in school settings where teachers who expect students to &#8220;bloom&#8221; behave in such a way that the students actually outperform peers who are not expected to bloom (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1" rid="c41">Rosenthal, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">More directly related to psycholegal research, expectations also shape behavior in all phases of criminal investigations (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Findley, 2012</xref>), particularly in response to confession evidence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Kassin, 2012</xref>). For example, interviewers led to believe in the guilt of a suspect select more guilt-presumptive questions than do interviewers led to believe the suspect is innocent. Moreover, these questions actually produce more defensive behavior from suspects, as judged by independent observers (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Kassin, Goldstein, &amp; Savitsky, 2003</xref>). Even without the interpersonal demands of an interrogation, expectations about the guilt of a suspect shape evaluations of a witness&#8217;s identification. As an example, people evaluate witnesses more positively if the witness&#8217;s statement confirms their suspicions of a suspect&#8217;s guilt than if it seems to exonerate the suspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Ask &amp; Granhag, 2007</xref>). Therefore, the very real possibility exists for interviewers to shape a witness&#8217;s report based on prior expectations (i.e., goals) that exist before an interview begins.</p>
<p align="left">There are many scenarios in which interviewers and eyewitnesses might have different goals for an interview. For example, suppose an interviewer fully embraces the Cognitive Interview but truncates a witness&#8217;s report. Why might this happen? Imagine an interviewer who interviews the last in a series of witnesses to the same crime. By this point, the interviewer is likely to have developed a schema for the crime and perhaps even harbor suspicion about a specific suspect. The interviewer may, therefore, be more interested in details that confirm what has previously been collected than in fully plumbing the depths of the last witness&#8217;s memory. This tendency would be consistent with research in social psychology that has demonstrated the <italic>confirmation bias</italic> wherein people seek out information that supports their existing belief (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Nickerson, 1998</xref>) or distorts existing information to support a prior belief (<italic>biased assimilation</italic>; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Lord, Ross, &amp; Lepper, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">To examine the impact of differences in interviewer&#8722;interviewee goals, witnesses in the current research were either told (a) to provide only accurate information or (b) to provide as much information as possible. Similarly, interviewers were either told (a) to collect only accurate information or (b) to collect as much information as possible. We chose to focus on goals that either emphasized quantity or accuracy, because people are known to trade-off these factors against one another in their memory reports in both general knowledge contexts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Koriat &amp; Goldsmith, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Goldsmith, Koriat, &amp; Weinberg-Eliezer, 2002</xref>) and eyewitness contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-1" rid="c55">Weber &amp; Brewer, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">To measure the impact of our goal manipulation on witness reports, we measured the grain size of details reported: whether a witness reports an item in very fine detail (e.g., he was wearing a navy blue V-necked sweater) or at a much coarser level (e.g., he was wearing a dark-colored sweater). When confidence in an item&#8217;s accuracy is high, witnesses tend to report fine levels of detail; when it is low, they are more likely to report coarse levels of detail. When confidence is very low, witnesses are likely to withhold information (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-2" rid="c16">Goldsmith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-2" rid="c55">Weber &amp; Brewer, 2008</xref>). Grain size is an important component of witness reports, and ignoring it can mask useful information. For example, some data have indicated that witnesses produce equivalent accuracy across retention intervals of different length (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Fisher, 1996</xref>); this pattern might be due to witnesses&#8217; choice to produce a smaller proportion of fine-grain details in favor of coarse-grain details as retention intervals increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-2" rid="c9">Fisher, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">Goldsmith, Koriat, &amp; Pansky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-3" rid="c55">Weber &amp; Brewer, 2008</xref>). To measure the impact of goals on interviewer behavior, we measured the number of words spoken, the type of questions asked, the amount of feedback delivered, and the type of feedback delivered; these variables are described in detail in the Method section.</p>
<p align="left">One possible outcome of manipulating goals is that eyewitness and interviewer behavior will be driven by the extent to which their respective instructions match, regardless of the actual content of the instructions. This possibility is suggested by research in industrial-organizational settings where clear understanding of job-specific duties (i.e., <italic>role clarity</italic> rather than <italic>role ambiguity</italic>, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Kahn, Wolfe, Quinn, Snoek, &amp; Rosenthal, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, &amp; Fetter, 1993</xref>) makes &#8220;&#8230;completion of one&#8217;s duties easier as a result of expectations being more explicit&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Panaccio &amp; Vandenberghe, 2011</xref>, p. 1460). To the extent that matching instructions facilitate role clarity, witnesses should find it easier to provide accurate information. Under this condition, eyewitnesses should produce a higher volume of accurate information (both fine- and coarse-grain details) because they can concentrate on their task, rather than being distracted by confusion over the goals of the interview. For their part, interviewers should be less involved in the interview because they trust that the witness understands the goals of the interview and does not need to be reminded with feedback or directive questions. That a subtle, unexpressed feature of the interviewer&#8722;interviewee relationship might produce measurable effects in memory reports, for example, is consistent with research that has shown the influences from nonblind photospread administrators on identification choices and eyewitness confidence, even in the absence of explicit influence attempts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">Phillips, McAuliff, Kovera, &amp; Cutler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Dysart, Lawson, &amp; Rainey, 2012</xref>, respectively).</p>
<p align="left">Alternatively, it is possible that eyewitness reports and interviewer behavior will be driven by the content of the instructions rather than whether the instructions match. This might occur if participants are attentive to the task, rather than the interaction between themselves and their interview partner. In this scenario, when witnesses have <italic>quantity</italic> instructions (i.e., give or collect as much information as possible), they should produce a relatively large volume of both fine- and coarse-grain information, but overall accuracy will be relatively low. But, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-3" rid="c16">Goldsmith et al. (2002)</xref>, even under quantity instructions, the precise output pattern will depend on how interviewees balance the competing demands for informativeness (i.e., maximizing the information available in a statement that is achieved through fine-grain reporting) and preserving accuracy (achieved by focusing on coarse-grain information). Natural tendencies to maximize informativeness or accuracy should result in biases toward fine- or coarse-grain reporting, respectively. Under quantity instructions, interviewers should probe for information by asking more questions (especially closed questions) and providing more feedback so to encourage witnesses to report anything they remember.</p>
<p align="left">In contrast, when witnesses have accuracy instructions, they should produce abundant but predominantly coarse-grain details because this should ensure reasonable accuracy while producing acceptable output quantity. However, to the extent that interviewees seek to be informative, it is also not out of the question that they will produce predominantly fine-grain details that are few in number but high in overall accuracy, because interviewees are trying to maximize informativeness while at the same time complying with the accuracy instruction (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-4" rid="c16">Goldsmith et al., 2002</xref>). For interviewers, instructions that encourage accuracy might be expected to produce directions to interviewees about the objectives of the interview at the outset. When the interview is underway, however, the interviewer might be expected to play a relatively passive role&#8212;apart from perhaps an occasional reminder about accuracy&#8212;because they have no way of evaluating the accuracy of the interviewee&#8217;s responses.</p>

<p align="left">The data for this study were collected in two locations, one large university in Australia (<italic>n</italic> = 17 pairs) and one small college in the United States (<italic>n</italic> = 21 pairs). Participants were compensated $20 AUD or $10 USD for approximately 30 min of their time.

<title>Procedure</title>
<p align="left">Two participants signed up for each 30-min time slot. Before the experiment began, students were asked to confirm that they did not know their partner. Participants were then randomly assigned to either the role of interviewer or witness by drawing from among slips of paper with a role printed on them. The interviewer remained seated in the waiting area, and the witness was escorted into the interview room. At this point, witnesses heard that the study was designed to examine &#8220;memory recall in eyewitness testimony.&#8221; They were randomly assigned to hear instructions to provide <italic>as much information as possible</italic> when describing the to-be-witnessed event (<italic>quantity</italic> condition) or to provide <italic>only accurate</italic> information (<italic>accuracy</italic> condition). Instructions were provide privately to each member of the pair. At this point, questions, if any, were answered about the content of the instructions. The witness was then left alone to watch a staged bank robbery video. This video was approximately 40 s long and depicted two men robbing a bank before escaping in a car (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-4" rid="c55">Weber &amp; Brewer, 2008</xref>). Each suspect&#8217;s face was clearly visible for several seconds in the video, as were those of the clerks and customers, as well as the getaway vehicle.</p>
<p align="left">While the witness watched the video, the experimenter returned to the waiting area to give the interviewers their instructions. Interviewers heard that the study was designed to examine the efficacy of different styles of police interviews and were instructed to either gather <italic>as much information as possible</italic> from their witness (<italic>quantity</italic> condition) or to elicit <italic>only accurate information</italic> (<italic>accuracy</italic> condition). Interviewers were told that the video was of a bank robbery, but received no further details and were not given a prescribed set of questions to ask. No mention was made to either the witness or the interviewer of the fact that their partner might receive different instructions.</p>
<p align="left">After the witness indicated that they had finished watching the bank robbery video, the interviewer was brought into the room where participants were informed that the interview would be videotaped so to provide an accurate transcript. Interviewers were given a sheet of paper to make notes of the witnesses&#8217; responses, but were told not to provide a verbatim record of the interview, because it would be possible to refer to the video to resolve any questions that might arise. The experimenter then turned on the video camera and left the room. Participants were instructed to open the door to the interview room when they were finished.</p>
<p align="left">Once participants indicated that they had concluded the interview, the experimenter returned, shut off the video camera, collected the interviewer&#8217;s notes, and asked each participant to fill out a short questionnaire about their experience during the interview.<xref ref-type="fn" id="fnc1-1" rid="fn1"><sup location="post">1</sup></xref> After instructing participants not to discuss their answers with one another, the experimenter stepped into the hall while the participants completed the questionnaires. Finally, participants were paid, fully debriefed, and thanked for their participation.</p>

<sec id="s8" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Coding eyewitness reports</title>
<p align="left">Each videotaped interview was transcribed and each discrete piece of information was coded for grain size (fine vs. coarse) and accuracy. For example, a witness who said that the culprits &#8220;got into a white old-looking car&#8221; was scored as providing one fine-grain accurate detail for &#8220;white&#8221; and two coarse-grain accurate details for &#8220;car&#8221; and &#8220;old-looking.&#8221; Interviews were also coded for the number of words used by the interviewer and witness. Each interview was coded by two independent coders, each of whom was blind to experimental condition. Cronbach&#8217;s alpha was calculated for a subset of 22 interviews (mean Cronbach&#8217;s alpha = .97, range: .94&#8722;.99). Coding disagreements were resolved by discussion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Coding interviewer behavior</title>

The type of question was categorized as either open (requiring a detailed response, e.g., &#8220;And, so what have you witnessed?&#8221;), closed (requiring a one or two word answer, e.g., &#8220;Did they have any weapons at all?&#8221;), multiple (introducing multiple options into the question, e.g., &#8220;Were [the robbers] normal sized or were they tall or short?&#8221;), and yes/no (requiring only a yes/no response, e.g., &#8220;Do you think he was on drugs?&#8221;) (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-2" rid="c42">Schreiber Compo et al., 2010</xref>).

<title>Eyewitness memory reports</title>
<p align="left">Eyewitness reports produced four dependent variables: number of coarse-grain accurate details, number of fine-grain accurate details, number of coarse-grain inaccurate details, and number of fine-grain inaccurate details. Most of our dependent variables were correlated, with values exceeding <italic>r</italic> = .30. Therefore, we conducted a 2 &#215; 2 (Interviewer Instructions &#215; Eyewitness Instructions) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). There were no main effects of either independent variable on eyewitness reports, <italic>F</italic>s(4, 31) &lt; 0.83, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .52, &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup>s &lt; .10, widest 95% CI for &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> [.00, .22].

<p align="left">To assess which variables were uniquely responsible for changes in eyewitness memory reports, we used a stepdown analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-1" rid="c52">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 1989</xref>) on the four dependent variables listed above: accurate coarse-grain details, accurate fine-grain details, inaccurate coarse-grain details, and inaccurate fine-grain details. To determine the order in which the dependent variables were entered into the stepdown procedure, we prioritized them as a function of the variance explained in the total number of fine- and coarse-grain details reported. Using a series of simple linear regressions, the variables in descending order were: number of coarse-grain accurate details, number of coarse-grain inaccurate details, number of fine-grain inaccurate details, and number of fine-grain accurate details.</p>
<p align="left">Once the prioritization of dependent variables was determined, each dependent variable was analyzed in a univariate two-way ANOVA with any higher priority dependent variables entered as covariates. The stepdown analysis revealed a significant unique contribution of accurate coarse-grain details to the interaction between eyewitness and interviewer instructions (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-1" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for results from stepdown analysis). Eyewitness performance was superior when instructions matched compared with mismatched. A two-sample <italic>t</italic> test indicated that the average number of accurate coarse-grain details was significantly higher when instructions matched (<italic>M</italic> = 26.89, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.43) compared with when they were mismatched (<italic>M</italic> = 19.50, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.33), <italic>t</italic>(36) = 3.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.06, 95% CI for <italic>d</italic> [0.53, 1.92] (see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-1" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p align="left">In Experiment 1, we manipulated instructions for eyewitnesses and interviewers in a dynamic interview paradigm. For eyewitnesses, we found that matching trumped content: the extent to which instructions matched mattered more than what the instructions actually were. Eyewitness performance was enhanced when their instructions matched their interviewer&#8217;s, as measured by the number of accurate coarse-grain details reported. The effect on eyewitnesses occurred despite the fact the videotaped interviews revealed that none of the pairs discussed their respective instructions with one another. Therefore, any effect of matching instructions was communicated through a mechanism more subtle than explicit confirmation of &#8220;being on the same page.&#8221; As noted in the introductory section, one possible mechanism for these effects is role clarity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-2" rid="c21">Kahn et al., 1964</xref>), whereby understanding the interaction goals makes the task easier to complete. Of note, the increased accuracy produced by eyewitnesses resulted from interviewer&#8722;eyewitness pairs in which instructions matched on accuracy <italic>or</italic> on quantity. That the matching of instructions was more important in producing accurate eyewitness reports than the content of instructions speaks to the role of the relationship between interviewer and eyewitness.</p>
<p align="left">If the relevant mechanism is role clarity, future research might find differences on questionnaire items assessing the extent to which each person understands their role in the interview or how easy it was to produce their reports. Similarly, if instructions are matched on the desire for fine-grain information or on the necessity to collect information on clothing, higher proportions of fine-grain or clothing-related information would be expected from eyewitnesses compared with those who produce reports in conditions in which instructions mismatched.</p>
<p align="left">The notion that role clarity is responsible for witnesses&#8217; increased accurate coarse-grain details is consistent with a broad range of motivational theories. At their most basic level, these theories argue that people&#8217;s behavior is shaped by the likelihood of obtaining positive outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Skinner, 1974</xref>). For example, some police officers have reported viewing shift choices as rewards, suggesting that the presence of an opportunity to select a desirable shift might encourage positive workplace behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Johnson, 2009</xref>). In the current context, the positive outcome is simply gaining the interviewer&#8217;s approval and believing oneself to be an effective witness. Future research directed at the precise features of the relationship that encourage accurate reporting might be useful avenues to improve the outcome of witness interviews.</p>
<p align="left">We found no effects of instructions on interviewer behavior. Regardless of the content of the instructions or the extent to which they matched their partner&#8217;s, interviewers behaved consistently throughout the interview. One explanation is that our interviewers&#8212;just as in many real crime situations&#8212;had no way of evaluating progress in relation to their goal. When instructed to collect only accurate information, for example, interviewers could not assess whether the information provided was accurate. Similarly, when instructed to collect as much information as possible, interviewers had no way of knowing whether witnesses had more information available to report. Another explanation is that our measures were not appropriately designed to detect differences of this type in interviewer behavior. Future research incorporating targeted dependent measures and manipulating interviewers&#8217; ability to assess performance might indicate that interviewer behavior does vary as a function of goal or matching as long as there is an objective standard against which to measure performance.</p>

<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p align="left">Experiment 1 demonstrated the impact of different goals for an investigative interview on eyewitness reports through a simple manipulation of instructions. Experiment 2 examined the effect of differences in access to forensic evidence. As with differences in instructions, the potential for differences in knowledge about evidence is clear. For example, interviewers might have access to evidence from analyses of the crime scene or conversations with other law enforcement officials; this information would be unavailable to witnesses. Similarly, witnesses have information unavailable to interviewers in the form of knowledge about the crime, perpetrator appearance, conversations with cowitnesses, and their own behavior.</p>
<p align="left">We elected to manipulate access to cowitness corroboration for three reasons. First, cowitness conversations are common: In a sample of 60 real witnesses in the United Kingdom, 88% reported having at least one cowitness, and 58% of those individuals discussed the crime with their cowitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-2" rid="c44">Skagerberg &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">Paterson &amp; Kemp, 2006</xref>). Second, cowitness information has powerful effects on identification decisions, memory reports, and confidence. Hearing misinformation about a perpetrator&#8217;s appearance from a cowitness can undermine subsequent identification accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr60-1" rid="c60">Zajac &amp; Henderson, 2009</xref>). Hearing a cowitness describe an event can affect memory reports (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-1" rid="c58">Wright, Self, &amp; Justice, 2000</xref>); hearing details about an event from a cowitness can affect recall, especially when the details are unseen by the witness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Hope, Ost, Gabbert, Healey, &amp; Lenton, 2008</xref>). Additionally, hearing about a cowitness&#8217;s identification decision can dramatically inflate or deflate a witness&#8217;s own confidence, depending on whether the cowitness corroborates or contradicts one&#8217;s own identification, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Luus &amp; Wells, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Finally, although there are no data specifically suggesting that cowitness information affects interviewers, several related lines of research support the potential for these effects. The first is that investigators&#8217; beliefs are malleable as a function of whether witnesses confirm their hypothesis about the identity of the suspect (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Dahl, Lindsay, &amp; Brimacombe, 2006</xref>). In one experiment, investigators who learned that their witness identified the suspect asked more leading questions than did investigators who learned nothing about their witness&#8217;s accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">MacLean, Brimacombe, Allison, Dahl, &amp; Kadlec, 2011</xref>). Additionally, as described earlier, investigators are susceptible to the confirmation bias. Most examinations of this effect have measured investigators&#8217; evaluations of a suspect, rather than of a witness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-2" rid="c1">Ask &amp; Granhag, 2007</xref>). However, evidence that a cowitness identified the same person as the to-be-interviewed witness might have parallel effects in that it encourages interviewers to confirm their preexisting hypothesis that the witness has an accurate recall of the event.</p>
<p align="left">To examine whether evidence about cowitness identifications affects an interview, we manipulated access to this evidence, as described below. We expected to find main effects of corroborating identifications on both eyewitness memory reports and interviewer behavior. For eyewitnesses, we expected that corroboration of their identification would increase their confidence in their memory of the event, thereby raising their reporting criterion. These witnesses should report fewer fine-grain details and fewer total details, because fewer details exceed the confidence threshold for reporting. In addition, the proportion of fine-grain (vs. coarse-grain) details should decrease.</p>
<p align="left">Partial evidence for this criterion shift would come from increases in witnesses&#8217; confidence as a function of hearing about corroborating evidence. Evidence for this possibility comes from criterion shifts in other research paradigms. For example, in the context of people attempting to recall words from a studied list, shifting the reporting criterion has been accomplished by manipulating study time: people who have studied a list extensively expect to have a stronger memory than those who have studied it less. As a result, they set a stricter criterion for reporting a word because they expect the target stimulus (if previously seen) to be highly familiar (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Morrell, Gaitan, &amp; Wixted, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">Stretch &amp; Wixted, 1998</xref>). Because we have no published research specifically addressing the impact of corroborated identifications on eyewitness memory reports, this prediction is necessarily tentative. For interviewers, we expected that corroboration of the eyewitness&#8217;s identification would elevate the interviewer&#8217;s confidence in the witness&#8217;s memory, encouraging the interviewer to rely on the witness to produce the best information, rather than having to solicit the information through detailed questions or repeated feedback. This should be reflected in fewer questions, fewer interruptions, and fewer words from the interviewer.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p align="left">As in Experiment 1, two participants were scheduled for each 30-min time slot, and participants were not allowed to sign up with a friend or acquaintance. Participants were randomly assigned to their roles using the methodology described in Experiment 1.</p>
<sec id="s19" disp-level="subsect3">
<title>Eyewitness procedure</title>
<p align="left">Eyewitnesses remained in the laboratory room and watched a mock crime video of several individuals robbing a storage unit.

<p align="left">After the video was over, biased instructions were used to ensure that all eyewitnesses made an identification (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Malpass &amp; Devine, 1981</xref>). In addition, because we did not want the corroboration manipulation to be confounded with identification accuracy, we used a target-absent lineup to ensure that any identification made was false. After the identification, eyewitnesses indicated how confident they were in their identification on a scale from 0% (<italic>not at all confident</italic>) to 100% (<italic>extremely confident</italic>). After providing their confidence rating, half of the participants heard nothing further about the accuracy of their identification or the extent to which others made the same identification.

<p align="left">After the interview, eyewitnesses rated their confidence in the accuracy of the memory report they had just provided using the same scale as used before the interview.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p align="left">In this experiment, we manipulated interviewers&#8217; and eyewitnesses&#8217; access to information about corroborating eyewitness identifications. These manipulations had a direct effect on interviewers. When corroborating information was not available to interviewers, they gave more negative feedback; there was a tendency to interrupt more and ask more yes/no questions. This collection of effects suggests two possible interpretations on the part of interviewers. On the one hand, it is possible that corroboration suggested to the interviewers that the witness&#8217;s overall memory was quite good, which would allow them to take a less active role during the interview, because they felt they could trust the witness to produce an accurate report without assistance. This is supported by the finding that interviewers who had corroborating information were more confident in the accuracy of the eyewitness&#8217;s identification and slightly more confident in the accuracy of the witness&#8217;s memory report. On the other hand, it is possible that interviewers with corroborating information were less involved in the interview because they felt that a detailed memory report of the crime was unnecessary in light of a well-supported identification.</p>
<p align="left">Eyewitness memory reports were not directly affected by the manipulation of corroborating identification evidence. For the confidence dependent measure, this result is attributable to the fact that eyewitnesses provided two confidence judgments: one before the corroboration manipulation was administered and one after. That an initial confidence judgment inoculated witnesses against subsequent inflation is consistent with research on the postidentification feedback effect in which prior thought about confidence mitigates the effect of feedback (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-1" rid="c56">Wells &amp; Bradfield, 1999</xref>). As for the null effects on other measures, two possible explanations emerge. One is that observing a criterion shift requires confidence judgments to shift (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-5" rid="c55">Weber &amp; Brewer, 2008</xref>). Because we found no differences in witnesses&#8217; confidence as a function of identification corroboration, a definitive assessment of whether the witnesses&#8217; criterion did shift was not possible. Alternatively, it is possible that the inoculation observed on confidence judgments extends to memory report measures as well. Extant data do not speak to this exact question; postidentification feedback manipulations have not yet been tested on the grain size of report details.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p align="left">The two experiments presented here extend our understanding of investigative interviews by showing the impact of preinterview differences on both eyewitness reports and interviewer behavior. In Experiment 1, matching instructions improved eyewitness memory reports, but did not change interviewer behavior. In Experiment 2, evidence about corroborating identifications reduced interviewers&#8217; involvement in the interview, but had no effect on eyewitnesses&#8217; memory reports.</p>
<p align="left">The effects presented in these two experiments demonstrate the critical role of preinterview differences in perspective. For example, when eyewitnesses and interviewers approach an interview with different goals, the results are startling. More than seven fewer accurate coarse-grain accurate details were obtained, a 27% decrease in the number of accurate coarse-grain details compared with a condition in which instructions matched. This result occurred even though the instruction manipulation was casually delivered and not highly specific. The omitted details could have serious implications for a police investigation. Indeed, most person descriptions are scant, averaging less than 10 characteristics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1" rid="c50">Sporer, 1992</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Meissner, Sporer, &amp; Schooler, 2007</xref>, for a review). Losing any of those accurate details substantially impairs the police&#8217;s ability to locate the perpetrator. Simply knowing that a getaway automobile was light-colored might represent a key bit of information when combined with information about the culprit from other sources.</p>
<p align="left">In addition to shaping the investigation by affecting the number of accurate details reported, the current research shows that differences in perspective derived from access to evidence also have important implications for an interviewer&#8217;s behavior. This is nicely demonstrated by Experiment 2, in which lack of evidence prompted interviewers to be more active. This finding is particularly suggestive because the manipulation tested here represents only one of the myriad ways for eyewitnesses and interviewers to arrive at an interview with different knowledge about evidence. At a minimum, interviewers will have knowledge about the extent to which corroborating evidence exists (or does not), and eyewitnesses will have privileged knowledge about the crime. Future research manipulating access to DNA or other forensic evidence might even show that an active interviewer increases witnesses&#8217; willingness to attempt an identification following the interview. Would this influence extend to the actual identification choice, making a mistaken identification more likely after an eyewitness interacts with an &#8220;active&#8221; interviewer? If so, the need to mitigate interviewers&#8217; influence on eyewitnesses becomes even more pressing.</p>
<p align="left">The observed differences in Experiment 1 are unequivocal improvements in eyewitness reports. However, we hesitate to categorically claim that matching instructions will always produce enhanced reports. For example, would interviewer&#8722;eyewitness pairs whose instructions both emphasized guessing produce improvements in the accuracy of eyewitness reports? In Experiment 2, interviewers&#8217; knowledge reduced their involvement in the interview, a change that is consistent with recommended interview protocols (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-4" rid="c14">Geiselman et al., 1984</xref>). This operationalization of differences in perspective was neutral in terms of producing improvements in eyewitness reports. Because we only tested one manipulation of differences in access to forensic evidence, we are not yet willing to offer a definitive assessment of whether access to forensic information will always produce more desirable behaviors. For both experiments reported here, varying the operationalization of differences in perspective will be necessary before a decisive conclusion can be drawn about the positive versus negative impact of differences in perspective.</p>
<p align="left">One interesting direction for future research concerns the use of schemas and scripts on the part of the interviewer rather than on the witness (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Mortimer, 1993</xref>). Although a number of studies have examined how a witness&#8217;s knowledge of crime-relevant schemas can affect their memories of the witnessed event (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Garc&#237;a-Bajos &amp; Migueles, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Greenberg, Westcott, &amp; Bailey, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1" rid="c53">Tuckey &amp; Brewer, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1" rid="c54">2003b</xref>), there has been no research that examines how an interviewer&#8217;s familiarity with the same schema might affect the way in which the interview is conducted. In Experiment 1, anecdotal evidence for this possibility comes from interviewers&#8217; questions about weapons. Witnesses who watched the bank robbery video in Experiment 1 never actually saw a weapon, though weapon presence was implied by the perpetrators&#8217; body language. In reporting on the presence of a weapon, witnesses fell into three categories: incorrectly reporting having seen a weapon (a schema-consistent error), tentatively suggesting that it <italic>looked like</italic> the two men were armed but they had not actually seen a gun, or simply indicating that there had been no weapons. Interviewers whose witnesses fell into the first category tended to simply note the information and move on with the interview. Interviewers whose witnesses fell in the latter two categories, however, often expressed surprise and asked several follow-up questions. After hearing a deliberately cautious, equivocal statement, some interviewers replied with the following: &#8220;So he had a gun, then.&#8221; One or two witnesses remained firm in their ambiguity by reiterating that it was only <italic>suggested</italic> that the men were armed, but the majority of witnesses in this situation acquiesced to this drastic alteration without argument. One interviewer was so perturbed by the equivocation that he said with blatant skepticism, &#8220;So you&#8217;re telling me that they just walked in and demanded the money without showing any weapons&#8230; and the lady just gave it to them?&#8221; Such an openly negative reaction might easily intimidate a timid or compliant witness into revising what was an accurate initial statement and, further, discourage them from reporting schema-incongruent details in the future.</p>
<p align="left">Given the previous research on the role of schemas in eyewitness memory, witnesses&#8217; tendency to include this inaccurate but schema-consistent information in their report is unsurprising. What is of greater interest is the extent to which interviewers&#8217; reliance on schemas might influence witness reports. Further research into how schemas might affect questioning and how such questioning might in turn affect witness memory would be useful in determining exactly how and to what extent this occurs. One study has demonstrated that witnesses&#8217; false memories for high-typicality actions persisted even in the face of explicit warnings of the potential for such errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-2" rid="c13">Garc&#237;a-Bajos &amp; Migueles, 2003</xref>). It would be worthwhile to explore whether such warnings might be more efficacious in modifying the behavior of the interviewers. Because warnings aimed at the interviewer would not have to compete with false memories, it seems possible that such interventions might be at least somewhat more successful in curbing such behavior.</p>
<p align="left">An important step for future research is to test how these witnesses and interviewers are evaluated by naive observers. For example, recent research has demonstrated the stark contrast in evaluations of an initial eyewitness confidence statement as a function of whether it is read by the witness at trial or seen on a videotape of the actual identification procedure. In that research, when confidence inflated between the initial identification procedure and the trial, ratings of the defendant&#8217;s guilt were reduced, but only when people saw the videotaped identification procedure, not when they merely heard the witness read a prior statement signifying low initial confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Douglass &amp; Jones, 2013</xref>). In the current research, recall that witness performance in Experiment 1 was superior when instructions matched. Will that enhanced performance translate into more positive evaluations of the witness and evaluations of the interviewers as placing less pressure on the witness? In Experiment 2, interviewers provided more negative feedback when they did not have information about corroborating identifications. Will witnesses whose interviewers provided more negative feedback be evaluated as less accurate, even though their objective accuracy is comparable to witnesses whose interviewers did not provide as much negative feedback? To answer such questions, showing the videotaped interviews to naive observers is critical.</p>
<p align="left">Another exciting possibility for future research is to examine the impact of the manipulations tested here on interviewers&#8217; memories. According to one study, interviewers who use the Cognitive Interview, compared with a structured interview, produce significantly more accurate details when reporting what the witness said (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">K&#246;hnken, Th&#252;rer, &amp; Zoberbier, 1994</xref>). In Experiment 2, interviewers were more involved in the interview when they did not have corroborating information. Would this involvement translate to better memory for the witness&#8217;s report details than when interviewers did not have corroborating information available? Or, would the involvement displayed by these interviewers disrupt their ability to form complete memories of what the witness reported?</p>
<p align="left">One potential limitation of our experiments is that we did not use &#8220;specialist&#8221; interviewers. However, there are two factors that lead us to conclude that this may not be a serious limitation. First, the percentage of words spoken by our interviewers was remarkably consistent with what is found for professional police interviewers. One study of 90 police interviews in Canada found that an average of 36% of the words spoken were by interviewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-3" rid="c48">Snook &amp; Keating, 2011</xref>). For our data, the comparable values were 34% in Experiment 1 and 36% in Experiment 2. Second, most police officers receive little or no training on how to interview witnesses, suggesting that, at least in terms of detailed training in how to conduct interviews, the police might not be entirely unlike our research participants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-2" rid="c47">Snook et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p align="left">These data reinforce the social nature of information gathering in a forensic context. In Experiment 1, accurate information was increased when witnesses&#8217; and interviewers&#8217; instructions matched, lending yet more support to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">Bartlett&#8217;s (1932)</xref> classic claim that &#8220;&#8230;&#8201;memory appears to be directly influenced by social facts&#8221; (p. 247). In Experiment 2, the interviewer&#8217;s lack of knowledge about corroborating identifications increased involvement in the interview. Even though accurate recollection can be increased in some social combinations (e.g., matching instructions in Experiment 1), the likelihood of recreating that precise experimental condition in the field is quite limited. Therefore, where possible, recall tools that eliminate or reduce the social aspect of remembering, such as the Self-Administered Interview (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">Gabbert, Hope, &amp; Fisher, 2009</xref>), eye closure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Perfect et al., 2008</xref>), or blind procedures, where possible (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-2" rid="c7">Dysart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-2" rid="c39">Phillips et al., 1999</xref>), should be advanced. In refining these protocols, psychological scientists should be vigilant for scenarios in which differences in perspective can emerge. Studies like the ones reported here will play an essential role in developing our understanding of these scenarios and their potential effect on eyewitness memory reports and interviewer behavior, allowing us to more completely assess the factors that shape investigative interviews.</p>
