<p align="left">Little is known about the sexual identity development process and psychological adjustment of lesbians living in Asia. The subjective well-being (SWB), including satisfaction with life, hope, and happiness, was assessed in relation to stage of sexual identity development for Chinese lesbians ages 18 to 42 with an online survey. Participants were 439 women living in China, Hong Kong/Macau, or Taiwan who were emotionally attracted to (romantically in love and/or sexually involved with) other women and identified with one of six sexual identity developmental stages of The Stage Allocation Measure (SAM). Participants identifying with later stages on the SAM reported being more hopeful and satisfied with their lives than individuals at early and middle stages. They were also more likely to have disclosed their sexual identity to family members. Women in committed relationships reported more life satisfaction and more disclosure of their sexual identity to family members. Directions for future research include conducting more emic studies in this area, and implications for clinicians include helping clients recognize that greater integration of sexual identity is associated with higher SWB.</p>

<p align="left">Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) populations have been slowly emerging in Chinese society (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Ching, 2010</xref>). Precise data on how many LGBT individuals reside in China (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) are elusive, but estimates vary from 3% to about 10% of the population. Thus, there may be 39 to 130 million LGBT individuals, with 19.5 to 65 million of them identifying as lesbian. The prevalence in specific subgroups can be much higher; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">Constable (2000)</xref> reported that up to 40% of migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong were lesbian. Limited empirical research has been conducted on this sizable population. Most academic research in China has focused on AIDS prevention among gay men (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">China Ministry of Health, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">Jeffreys, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-1" rid="c55">Wu, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">The coming out process among lesbians living in China and Hong Kong was the focus of a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Chow and Cheng (2010)</xref>. Their findings suggested significant relations among levels of shame, internalized heterosexism, and devaluing one&#8217;s sexual identity. Structural equation modeling revealed that those variables were associated with participants being less likely to come out to others. Shame was also associated with perceptions of less social support from friends. Despite efforts such as these to move beyond AIDS prevention research, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-2" rid="c13">Ching (2010)</xref> noted that academic study of LGBT topics &#8220;&#8230; are still marked in mainland China and Hong Kong as territories for the impossible and unthinkable, inhabited by stigma, silence, risk, and frustration&#8221; (p. 2).</p>
<p align="left">Since the mid-1950s, Western samples have been used in studies of topics related to the etiology of lesbianism; lesbian psychological and social functioning; life span and sexual identity development; and professional interventions with lesbians and their families (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Bieschke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">McCarn &amp; Fassinger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Rothblum, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">Tully, 1995)</xref>. Consequently, most of what is known about sexual identity development comes from Western samples. The current study was conducted to provide insight into this process in a Chinese sample.</p>

<title>Sexual Identity Development</title>
<p align="left">An important aspect of defining oneself as lesbian is the coming out or sexual identity development process. Sexual identity development is often delayed in lesbians and gays owing to society&#8217;s stigmatization of same-sex attraction and relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Cass, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">Peterson &amp; Gerrity, 2006)</xref>, and to sexuality being hidden from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Bringaze &amp; White, 2001)</xref>. Individuals often go through an adjustment process during sexual identity development that can take years to navigate, and some individuals never fully develop sexual identities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-2" rid="c9">Cass, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Flowers &amp; Buston, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-2" rid="c37">McCarn &amp; Fassinger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1" rid="c50">Troiden, 1989)</xref>.</p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-3" rid="c9">Cass (1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">1984</xref>) published a model of lesbian/gay identity development that has formed the foundation for much of the subsequent work in this area. The Cass model is widely cited, has intuitive appeal (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1" rid="c44">Radonsky &amp; Borders, 1996)</xref>, and has been described as one of the most &#8220;affirming descriptions of gay identity&#8221; in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Frable, 1997</xref>, p. 150). The model posits six stages of sexual identity development that incorporate cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of people&#8217;s experiences. From the perspective of a lesbian woman progressing through the model, the first stage, <italic>Identity Confusion</italic>, entails becoming aware of same-sex thoughts, feelings, and attractions, and then experiencing confusion and turmoil. In this stage she may ask, &#8220;Am I lesbian?&#8221; The <italic>Identity Comparison</italic> stage involves accepting the possibility that she is lesbian and the tentative commitment to this awareness. A primary task in this stage is to deal with the social alienation one encounters with increasing awareness of differences between lesbians and heterosexuals. Stage III is called <italic>Identity Tolerance</italic>, wherein she acknowledges that she is likely lesbian and has increased commitment to her sexual identity. Although the sense of social alienation is heightened, she seeks out other lesbians or gays to alleviate her feelings of isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Cox &amp; Gallois, 1996)</xref>. A critical factor in this stage is the emotional contact she makes with others in the LGBT community (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-4" rid="c9">Cass, 1979)</xref>. Next is the <italic>Identity Acceptance</italic> stage where she develops a positive lesbian identity that she accepts, begins to feel more &#8220;normal,&#8221; and views her subculture positively. <italic>Identity Pride</italic> is the fifth stage and is characterized by a nearly complete acceptance of LGBT identity coupled with an acute awareness of the prevalence of heterosexism in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-5" rid="c9">Cass, 1979)</xref>. Individuals often immerse themselves in the LGBT culture while minimizing contact with heterosexuals. The final stage is <italic>Identity Synthesis</italic> in which individuals integrate their sexual identity with all other aspects of self, and sexual orientation becomes only one important part of who they are. There is more contact with supportive heterosexuals, and one&#8217;s personal and public sexual identities become more unified. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-2" rid="c10">Cass (1984)</xref> noted that individuals can work through each stage, remain at a particular stage, or undergo identity foreclosure by terminating movement in the sexual identity development process altogether.</p>
<p align="left">In a validation study, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-3" rid="c10">Cass (1984)</xref> found support for her six-stage linear model, but noted that differences between participants in stages 1 and 2 and between stages 5 and 6 were not easily distinguishable. Although there were gender differences in her Australian sample, both women and men responded in a manner predicted by the model. Using a sample of gay men in the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Brady and Busse (1994)</xref> found a significant relationship between endorsing Cass stages 3 through 6 and psychological well-being and adjustment. These findings provided preliminary support for Cass&#8217; model, and others have also provided support for the model with lesbian samples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Kahn, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Levine, 1997)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1" rid="c53">White, Rice, and Myers (2000)</xref> conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 12 American lesbians. Although they found support for Cass&#8217; six stages and concluded that sexual identity appeared to progress through multiple stages, not all people passed through each stage or progressed in a linear sequence. Others have also criticized the model&#8217;s linear progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Akerlund &amp; Cheung, 2000)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1" rid="c54">Worell and Remer (1992)</xref> noted that stage models may be useful in helping to understand common coming out experiences, but may not capture unique experiences.</p>
<p align="left">To date, no studies have applied the Cass model to Asian samples. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Li and Orleans (2001)</xref> conducted a qualitative study on Asian American lesbians regarding their coming out process. Although not specifically testing Cass&#8217; model, their participants described important aspects of each stage as being part of their sexual identity development, thus offering some indirect support for this model. Later work supported the relationship between sexual identity development and psychological adjustment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Elizur &amp; Ziv, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Halpin &amp; Allen, 2004)</xref>. Although there have been other models of sexual identity development specific to lesbians proposed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">Chapman &amp; Brannock, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-3" rid="c37">McCarn &amp; Fassinger, 1996)</xref>, we selected Cass&#8217; model because it is the most widely cited model and has been included in &gt;3 decades of research and theoretical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-4" rid="c37">McCarn &amp; Fassinger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-2" rid="c53">White et al., 2000)</xref>. Unlike many other models, Cass&#8217; is considered to be &#8220;theoretically grounded, empirically tested, and reasonably detailed&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-2" rid="c24">Frable, 1997</xref>, p. 150); however, we would have preferred using a model that was developed using Chinese or Asian samples, if one had been available.</p>

<title>Sexual Identity Development and Chinese Culture</title>
<p align="left">An individual&#8217;s first perception of her sexual orientation is strongly influenced by the social structure or culture in which she lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-6" rid="c9">Cass, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-4" rid="c10">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Fassinger, 1991)</xref>. Geographical factors and social isolation may intensify experiences of alienation, loss, confusion, and turmoil (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-2" rid="c35">Li &amp; Orleans, 2001)</xref>. Therefore, it is important to consider Chinese culture&#8217;s influence on sexual identity development. China&#8217;s Confucian values emphasize family and social harmony over the individual, and children are representatives of their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Han, 2000)</xref>. Lesbians are viewed as rejecting their most important roles&#8212;being wives and mothers. This rejection also implies that their parents have failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-3" rid="c13">Ching, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-3" rid="c35">Li &amp; Orleans, 2001)</xref> and can result in increased feelings of shame (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-2" rid="c14">Chow &amp; Cheng, 2010)</xref>. During sexual identity development, lesbians are likely to be acutely aware of their society&#8217;s and culture&#8217;s lack of acceptance, which may in turn impact their satisfaction with life, hope for the future, and happiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Jordan &amp; Deluty, 1998)</xref>. A positive lesbian/gay identity has been related to healthy psychological adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-2" rid="c21">Elizur &amp; Ziv, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-2" rid="c25">Halpin &amp; Allen, 2004)</xref>.</p>
<p align="left">From a sociopolitical standpoint, ancient Chinese society was actually more accepting of same-sex relationships, but attitudes changed during the mid- to late-19th century after China was defeated and occupied by Western forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1" rid="c46">Ruan, 1991)</xref>. In the 1940s, homosexuality was severely punished, and in the 1950s to 1970s, it served as grounds for political persecution (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-2" rid="c55">Wu, 2003)</xref>. It remained in the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD-3) until 2001, and a diagnosis resembling ego-dystonic homosexuality remains.</p>

<title>Identity Development and Subjective Well-Being</title>
<p align="left">Although it is important for psychologists to be knowledgeable about the possible psychological problems encountered by lesbians during sexual identity development, the factors that enhance their subjective well-being (SWB) are equally important to consider. There are lesbians who have experienced oppression and discrimination owing to homophobia and heterosexism who are psychologically healthy and use adaptive coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">Anderson &amp; Sussex, 1999)</xref>. They may exhibit unique strengths in response to oppression; those strengths may help them to cope behaviorally and emotionally with hardships (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-4" rid="c13">Ching, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Kulkin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-2" rid="c51">Tully, 1995)</xref>. Viewing sexual identity development from a strength-based perspective rather than one of psychopathology may make it possible to discover how lesbians successfully adapt to these experiences. There is a general emphasis on negative states in psychological research, as evidenced by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">Myers and Diener&#8217;s (1995)</xref> finding that studies examining negative outcomes outnumber those examining positive ones by a ratio of 17:1. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-1" rid="c49">Snyder et al. (2003)</xref> showed that a person&#8217;s strengths are best viewed through the lens of his or her already existing coping skills and talents. Theory and research have suggested that SWB is a broad category that includes components of pleasure, fulfillment of basic human needs, and evaluative judgments of life quality (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Diener &amp; Suh, 2000)</xref>. To date, no studies have examined the SWB of Chinese lesbians during their sexual identity development, and thus, we made this a focus of our study.</p>
<p align="left">The need for this investigation was initially assessed by the first author posting messages on discussion boards of eight Chinese lesbian Web sites. In just 4 days, her posts received the highest volume of traffic for those sites, suggesting much interest. Respondents indicated strong opinions that such research should focus on positive outcomes and strengths, rather than just adjustment difficulties. Therefore, the present study was designed to provide such information on the SWB of Chinese lesbians during various stages of sexual identity development. It was hypothesized that individuals in the later stages would report higher levels of hope, satisfaction with life, and happiness (including a lower level of depression).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p align="left">After obtaining approval of the study&#8217;s protocol by the host university&#8217;s Institutional Review Board (IRB), we recruited 1,084 female participants over a 2-week period from 39 Chinese Web sites oriented toward lesbians. All the participants identified as being of Chinese descent and emotionally attached (romantically in love and/or sexually involved) with other females. Only those who completed the entire questionnaire were included in the final study sample. Participants were omitted from the study owing to one or more of the following exclusion criteria: 84 (7.75%) grew up outside of China, Hong Kong/Macau, or Taiwan; 32 (2.95%) were under the age of 18; and 445 participants (41.05%) did not fully complete questionnaires, with the majority of those following the study link but not completing a single item (<italic>N</italic> = 374; 34.5%). After applying exclusion criteria, 439 (40.5%) participants remained. Demographic characteristics for these participants are presented in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-1" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. They resided in four major areas of China (mainland China, 86.6%; Hong Kong, 9.1%; Taiwan, 3.9%; Macau, 0.5%), ranged in age from 18 to 42 with a mean age of 24.51 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.344), and a majority were in their 20s (78.4%). The number of years since identifying as lesbian ranged from 0 to 31, with a mean of 7.53 (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.097), and patterns of disclosing sexual identity are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-2" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl1"/></p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p align="left">Participants were informed that the purpose of the study was &#8220;to look at variables associated with Chinese lesbians&#8217; adjustment during their sexual identity development.&#8221; A link directed participants to the study&#8217;s online survey hosted by the Psychdata.com Web site. All study materials were presented in Mandarin and Cantonese, but owing to the way the data were compiled by the Web site, it is not known how many responded to each version. The online survey was preceded by a cover letter that described the study and explained that participants&#8217; voluntary responses were anonymous. Links to the online informed consent process and study survey were placed on each discussion board Web site for 2 weeks, and no incentive was offered for study participation. The Internet was chosen as a recruitment tool for this survey because traditional studies have encountered difficulties recruiting participants in the early stages of sexual identity formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-2" rid="c6">Brady &amp; Busse, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1" rid="c41">Nesmith, Burton, &amp; Cosgrove, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1" rid="c47">Sell &amp; Petrulio, 1996)</xref>.

<p align="left">The online study survey consisted of a custom demographic questionnaire, the Stage Allocation Measure (SAM; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-7" rid="c9">Cass, 1979)</xref>, and the following instruments selected to measure SWB: Adult Dispositional Hope Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">Snyder et al., 1991)</xref>; Satisfaction with Life Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &amp; Griffin, 1985)</xref>; and Depression&#8211;Happiness Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">McGreal &amp; Joseph, 1993)</xref>. To increase the likelihood of translation equivalency (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Brislin, 1993)</xref>, a bilingual Chinese American Counseling Psychologist, a bilingual international graduate student from Mainland China, and the first author (also from Mainland China) collaborated in translating the questionnaires into Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese). The Chinese American Counseling Psychologist first translated the original English survey into Chinese, then the bilingual international graduate student translated the Chinese version back to English, and finally the first author looked for discrepancies between the translated English to Chinese to English versions and the original version of the survey. The translation group also determined whether the meanings of translated words were retained and through consensus the final wordings of the two Chinese translations were decided upon.</p>

These authors reported that the scale demonstrated adequate internal consistency (&#945; = 0.74 to 0.78) and test&#8211;retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .85 over 3 weeks) in samples of undergraduates, and presented initial evidence for convergent and discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-3" rid="c48">Snyder et al., 1991)</xref>.

Data collected using the 12 items translated for the present study, however, demonstrated inadequate internal consistency (Cronbach&#8217;s alpha = 0.556), so scale item-total correlation statistics were used to identify the items most contributing to this poor reliability. Based on those statistics, the authors removed two items: 5 (&#8220;I am easily downed in an argument&#8221;) and 3 (&#8220;I feel tired most of the time&#8221;).

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p align="left">We used a multivariate analysis of variance model (MANOVA) to investigate differences in the dependent variables of SWB (Hope, Satisfaction with Life, Depression&#8211;Happiness) at levels of sexual identity development (SAM stages). Post hoc tests were planned to determine statistically significant differences between SAM stage groups for each of the three dependent variables using a Bonferroni adjustment to the overall alpha level. We also included the following demographic characteristics as independent variables along with all two-way interactions among them: relationship status, education level, and coming out status for family members (dichotomized into 1 = came out to at least one family member and 2 = never came out to a family member). Coming out status in general was not included, given that only 25 people reported not telling anyone about their sexuality, and 13 of those identified as uncertain or exploring their sexuality. Since only participant age correlated significantly (<italic>p</italic> = .041) with SWLS total score, and a scatter plot for these two variables failed to show a recognizable linear relationship, no covariates were added to the model. The final sample size was considered adequate, with sufficient numbers of participants in each of the SAM stages. We investigated potential outliers using Mahalanobis distance statistics and analyzed bivariate correlations between dependent variables to identify any potential multicollinearity. To investigate potential deviations from the assumptions of linearity, multivariate normality, homoscedasticity, and homogeneity of variance&#8211;covariance matrices, we examined scatter, normal Q-Q, and histogram plots, skew and kurtosis statistics, Levene&#8217;s test, and the <italic>Box&#8217;s M</italic> statistic.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p align="left">Descriptive statistics for all continuous variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-4" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. Preliminary analyses suggested no significant violations of the assumptions underlying these analyses, and we found no evidence for significant outliers or multicollinearity. Some evidence suggested a lack of equality in covariance matrices across groups (<italic>Box&#8217;s M</italic> = 334.871, <italic>p</italic> = .001), and so Pillai&#8217;s trace was used in the multivariate analyses, and Bartlett&#8217;s Test of Sphericity was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Multivariate results suggested that none of the interaction effects explained significant proportions of variance in our dependent variables, and results are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc3-1" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. Significant multivariate main effects were found for SAM stage, education level, and current relationship status, and so univariate analyses were conducted separately with an adjusted 0.05/3 = 0.016 &#945; level. Levene&#8217;s test indicated that homoscedasticity assumptions were met for all three dependent variables (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05 for all three). When examining the dependent variables separately, results suggested that only SWLS scores, <italic>F</italic>(5, 411) = 5.771, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, &#951;<sub location="post" arrange="stack"><italic>p</italic></sub><sup location="post" arrange="stack"><italic>2</italic></sup> = .066, and Hope-R scores, <italic>F</italic>(5, 411) = 3.238, <italic>p</italic> = .007, &#951;<sub location="post" arrange="stack"><italic>p</italic></sub><sup location="post" arrange="stack"><italic>2</italic></sup> = .038, demonstrated significant differences by SAM stage.

<p align="left">We then conducted planned comparisons between all six SAM stages for the two dependent variables identified in univariate analyses using the Tukey&#8217;s HSD post hoc test and controlled for potential Type I errors using a more stringent &#945; of 0.05/30 = 0.0016 (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc4-1" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). We found significant differences in SWLS scores between participants in Stage I (<italic>M</italic> = 14.81) and Stage 6 (<italic>M</italic> = 23.41) (mean difference = &#8722;8.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); Stage II (<italic>M</italic> = 16.30) and Stage 6 (mean difference = &#8722;7.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); and Stage III (<italic>M</italic> = 17.09) and Stage 6 (mean difference = &#8722;6.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Comparisons for Hope-R total scores indicated significant differences between participants in Stage III (<italic>M</italic> = 27.04) and Stage 6 (<italic>M</italic> = 29.67) (mean difference = &#8722;2.64, <italic>p</italic> = .001).

<p align="left">Given the limited research on SAM stages and Chinese lesbians, we conducted the following post hoc analyses to see whether our sample responded in a manner consistent with the SAM model. Relationships between the demographic variables, measures of SWB, and sexual identity development were further explored. We found a statistically significant relationship between SAM stage and relationship status, &#967;<sup location="post"><italic>2</italic></sup> (10, <italic>N</italic> = 439) = 32.541, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, with more participants in stages 4 through 6 being in committed relationships, and more participants in earlier stages being single or not dating (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc5-1" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). The percentages of participants in uncommitted dating relationships were fairly consistent across the six stages. Our results also suggest that the number of close family members to whom participants had disclosed their sexuality identity varied according to SAM stage, &#967;<sup location="post"><italic>2</italic></sup> (20, <italic>N</italic> = 439) = 101.655, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, with women in later stages being more likely to self-disclose, although many in each stage had not disclosed to any family members.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl5"/></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p align="left">We had sufficient numbers of participants self-select into each stage and, similar to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-3" rid="c53">White et al., 2000)</xref>, those in later stages were different from those in earlier stages in meaningful and theoretically consistent ways. We found significant relationships between stages of sexual identity development and ratings on measures of SWB, which is also consistent with previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-3" rid="c6">Brady &amp; Busse, 1994)</xref>. Participants at later stages had significantly higher scores on both the Satisfaction with Life and Dispositional Hope measures.</p>
<p align="left">A different pattern emerged for participants in the middle SAM stages, with a possible transition point between stages 3 and 4. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-9" rid="c9">Cass (1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-6" rid="c10">1984</xref>), individuals in stage 3 (Identity Tolerance) acknowledge they are likely lesbian and have increased commitment to their sexual identity, but they also have a heightened sense of social alienation and feelings of aloneness. It is possible that those feelings hold them back from seeking partners and publicly coming out. Supporting this was our finding that those in SAM stages 1 to 3 were more likely to be single. This may reflect the increased confusion, isolation, and lack of social support in these earlier developmental stages and participants&#8217; difficulty manifesting their identities in lesbian relationships. Stage IV (Identity Acceptance) is characterized by individuals developing a more positive lesbian identity, making more contacts in the LGBT community, and feeling more &#8220;normal.&#8221; With accompanying senses of belonging and acceptance, they may feel more secure to date and come out to others. The later stages of Identity Pride and Identity Synthesis are characterized by an even more positive sense of self, and study participants in stage 6 endorsed higher levels of life satisfaction compared with those in early and middle stages, as well as higher levels of hope compared with those in the middle stages.</p>
<p align="left">It is possible that other variables, such as social desirability, age, or education level, could have accounted for these findings. If social desirability had a significant contribution, however, it would seem likely that participants would have self-selected into later SAM stages that reflected higher levels of sexual identity development. But equal numbers of participants (<italic>N</italic> = 59) endorsed being in stages 1 and 2 as being in stages 5 and 6 (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-4" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We also found no relationships between SAM stage and age or education levels. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-7" rid="c10">Cass (1984)</xref>, stage 4 was the most endorsed stage in our sample. We also found that life satisfaction scores differed by relationship status, with those in committed relationships endorsing higher scores than participants who were single or dating. This may reflect that those in committed relationships have more access to support systems that contribute to less alienation from interpersonal environments and more satisfaction with life. Although this study was not designed to validate the Cass model directly, it does provide some support for it in a Chinese sample.</p>
<sec id="s17" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p align="left">Our participants were predominantly in their 20s and college educated. All had computer and Internet access. Thus, generalizability of our findings is limited. Our cross sectional design makes it impossible to draw conclusions regarding developmental progression through SAM stages. Because we did not follow participants over time, we do not know whether they progressed through stages in the hypothesized manner. Future longitudinal research may evaluate how participants progress through each of the SAM stages, and whether all six stages are even necessary.</p>
<p align="left">A major limitation is our choice to use a model of identity development and outcome measures created for Western samples. This approach may have unintentionally imposed ideas and values that are irrelevant to Chinese culture. Some study participants expressed concern that aspects of their coming out experiences were not being adequately captured. An emic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Berry, 1989)</xref> would have studied these experiences from within the Chinese culture, perhaps by first conducting qualitative interviews with individuals and/or focus groups, developing a model to account for these experiences, and then testing it. This more culturally sensitive approach would be useful in future research.</p>
<p align="left">The translation of instruments originally written in English also represents a limitation. Two items from the original Dispositional Hope Scale needed to be omitted to have acceptable internal consistency, and this may reflect lack of translation equivalency. In addition, our outcome measures reflected a more independent self-construal than an interdependent one. Despite the limitations of etic research, we conducted our study from this perspective because sexual identity development may have common elements across cultures. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Berry (2013)</xref> wrote that if we are to achieve a global psychology, we need to study phenomena from both etic and emic perspectives. He cautioned etic researchers about imposing their findings as truths for a cultural group, but rather encouraged them to understand and modify their findings according to emic research. This interaction between etic and emic perspectives &#8220;&#8230; should lead eventually to the formulation of <italic>derived etics</italic> which are valid cross-culturally, and may result in establishing some general principles of human behavior&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-2" rid="c4">Berry, 2013</xref>, p. 58). Researchers are encouraged to study how etic and emic approaches can advance our understanding of this phenomenon.</p>
<p align="left">In addition to being a Western measure, the SAM assessed sexual identity from a developmental stage perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-2" rid="c1">Akerlund &amp; Cheung, 2000)</xref>. Dimensional models that focus on important experiences occurring throughout sexual identity development have also been proposed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Diamond, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Horowitz &amp; Newcomb, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">Mohr &amp; Fassinger, 2000)</xref>. These models account for different degrees of outness (e.g., family, friends, coworkers), and recognize that coming-out tasks can reemerge over time. While also developed in the west, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-3" rid="c14">Chow and Cheng (2010)</xref> used a dimensional measure of sexual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-2" rid="c39">Mohr &amp; Fassinger, 2000)</xref> with their Chinese samples. Similar to our study, they found those who valued their lesbian identities had better adjustment (i.e., less shame) and were more likely to come out to others. Thus, two types of Western sexual identity development measures have demonstrated meaningful and theoretically consistent differences in Chinese samples. Further research to identify culturally unique and shared aspects of coming out in China should continue.</p>
<p align="left">More than 41% (<italic>N</italic> = 445) of individuals following the link to this study did not complete the questionnaires, and the majority did not complete a single item (<italic>N</italic> = 374). Why? It is possible that some followed the link and then decided to come back to complete the survey later. This possibility is supported by people contacting the first author after the link had been removed and asking whether they could still participate in the study. It is also possible that potential participants did not like or understand what they saw. We also do not know whether someone completed the survey more than once. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-4" rid="c14">Chow and Cheng (2010)</xref> collected the IP addresses of computers used to complete their study to omit duplicate entries from the same computer. Future studies may want to follow their lead. Given that our link was active for only 2 weeks, the amount of time someone had to make multiple submissions was limited.</p>
<p align="left">Despite these limitations, it is hoped this study will stimulate further research on emerging Chinese LGBT communities. The hypotheses posed here provided a starting point, and future studies may further examine the cultural differences between subgroups of Chinese lesbians (e.g., rural/urban, political/nonpolitical) and consider confounding demographic variables such as geographic region, religion/spirituality, language (Mandarin vs. Cantonese), and socioeconomic status (SES).</p>

<title>Implications for Counseling and Advocacy</title>
<p align="left">Given the strong Confucian beliefs within Chinese culture, it is important for psychologists working with lesbian clients to be knowledgeable of the cultural, familial, and community implications of coming out. Disclosing a lesbian sexual identity affects the entire family in ways not experienced in the West. For example, in parts of China, it is expected that a groom&#8217;s family purchase a home for the married couple, which is a way that many brides&#8217; families improve their social standing (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Lucetta, 2010)</xref>. It is important for clinicians to assist lesbian clients to consider realistic consequences of coming out, and to balance individual and family values. Although daughters may fear bringing shame to their families by coming out, we found coming out to family members was associated with higher levels of SWB.</p>
<p align="left">Perhaps fear is a common feature of sexual identity development across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Heatherington &amp; Lavner, 2008)</xref>. Helping clients to realistically assess and test their fears may lead to quicker and/or greater integration of their sexuality into other aspects of their lives. It may also be helpful to inform clients that things will get better. Those who had greater integration of their sexual identity (as measured by later SAM stages) had greater life satisfaction and hope.</p>
<p align="left">Advocacy efforts could target individuals likely to endorse the earliest SAM stages, as this study found they had the lowest scores on measures of SWB and were less likely to come out to others. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-8" rid="c10">Cass (1984)</xref> also found them to be less likely to seek support from others. Advocacy may also be directed toward individuals with less integrated sexual identities, who were found to have greater levels of shame and internalized heterosexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-5" rid="c14">Chow &amp; Cheng, 2010)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-6" rid="c13">Ching (2010)</xref> noted that web-based communication has been embraced by the Chinese lesbian community. Consequently, outreach efforts could target lesbian Web sites, where warning signs for adjustment difficulties are discussed and suggestions are offered for what a friend can do. Referrals to supportive groups or individual mental health professionals could also be provided.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p align="left">This is the first study to investigate the subjective well-being of Chinese lesbians as related to sexual identity developmental stages. We hope that the results and subsequent unanswered questions will stimulate future research in this area.</p>
