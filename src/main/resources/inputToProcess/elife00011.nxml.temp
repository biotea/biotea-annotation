Based on the transcription feedback loops important for circadian timekeeping, it is commonly assumed that this mRNA cycling reflects widespread transcriptional regulation. To address this issue, we directly measured the circadian dynamics of mouse liver transcription using Nascent-Seq (genome-wide sequencing of nascent RNA). Although many genes are rhythmically transcribed, many rhythmic mRNAs manifest poor transcriptional rhythms, indicating a prominent contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to circadian mRNA expression. This analysis of rhythmic transcription also showed that the rhythmic DNA binding profile of the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 does not determine the transcriptional phase of most target genes. This likely reflects gene-specific collaborations of CLK:BMAL1 with other transcription factors. These insights from Nascent-Seq indicate that it should have broad applicability to many other gene expression regulatory issues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00011.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00011.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00011.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many biological processes oscillate with a period of roughly 24 hr, and the ability of organisms as diverse as bacteria and humans to maintain such circadian rhythms, even under conditions of continuous darkness, influences a range of phenomena, including sleep, migration and reproduction. One characteristic of circadian rhythms is that they can adjust to local time (with humans suffering from jet lag as they wait for this to happen).</p><p>Experiments have shown that the circadian system in mammals relies on feedback loops that operate at the level of individual cells. These loops are controlled by two particular proteins, which comprise the transcription factor complex called BMAL1:CLK. Transcription factors cause particular sequences of bases in the DNA of cells to be transcribed into messenger RNA, thus starting the process by which target genes are expressed as proteins. In the case of BMAL1:CLK, these proteins are then modified, which inhibits any further transcription of the target genes. A reversal of these modifications is then followed by the synthesis of new proteins, which allows a new cycle of the transcription process to begin.</p><p>The amounts of many messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in a cell also increases and decreases with a period of 24 hr, and it was generally assumed that this was due to the changes in the level of transcription. More recently, however, it was suggested that other processes, such as splicing and translation, might also contribute to rhythmic changes in the amount of mRNA associated with particular genes. Such post-transcriptional processes are known to have a role in other areas of cell biology, including aspects of the circadian system, but until very recently this had not been studied in detail for all genes.</p><p>Now Menet et al. have directly assayed rhythmic transcription by measuring the amount of nascent mRNA being produced at a given time, six times a day, across all the genes in mouse liver cells using a high-throughput sequencing approach called Nascent-Seq. They compared this with the amount of liver mRNA expressed at six time points of the day. Although the authors found that many genes exhibit rhythmic mRNA expression in the mouse liver, about 70% of them did not show comparable transcriptional rhythms. Post-transcriptional regulation must, therefore, have a major role in the circadian system of mice and, presumably, other mammals.</p><p>Menet et al. also found that the influence of CLK:BMAL1 differed from what was expected, which suggests that it collaborates with a number of other transcription factors to effect transcription of most target genes. In addition to showing that circadian systems of mammals are more complex than previously believed, the results also illustrate the potential of Nascent-Seq as a genome-wide assay technique for exploring a range of questions related to gene expression and gene regulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00011.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00011.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Circadian rhythms</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>nascent RNA</kwd><kwd>high-throughput sequencing</kwd><kwd>RNA processing</kwd><kwd>post-transcriptional regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosbash</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source>National Science Foundation: Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship</funding-source><award-id>DGE 0549390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodriguez</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health: Genetics Training Grant</funding-source><award-id>5T32GM007122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodriguez</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>0.1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-wide measurements on mouse liver cells show that transcription, and a particular key transcription factor, have a smaller than expected influence on the mouse circadian system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most organisms from bacteria to humans possess circadian rhythms, which generate oscillations in biochemistry, physiology and behavior. The circadian system in eukaryotes is based on cell-autonomous molecular oscillators, which rely on transcriptional feedback loops. In mammals, the transcription factor BMAL1 acts as a dimer with either CLOCK (CLK) or Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) to activate the transcription of many genes, including the transcriptional repressors <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Per3</italic>) and <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Cry2</italic>). The PERs and CRYs are expressed, post-translationally modified, feedback to inhibit their own transcription and are then rhythmically degraded to lead to a new round of BMAL1:CLK or BMAL1:NPAS2 -mediated transcription (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ko and Takahashi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dardente and Cermakian, 2007</xref>). This temporal regulation of clock gene transcription cycles with a period of about 24 hr and probably underlies much of circadian biology.</p><p>Over the past decade, clock gene transcriptional regulation has been described in many species and tissues, where it drives the rhythmic expression of a large fraction of the mRNA population (up to 10&#x2013;15% of all mRNAs in a single mammalian tissue; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vollmers et al., 2009</xref>). Rhythmic mRNA expression has mostly been characterized by analyzing temporal changes of steady-state mRNA levels, using techniques such as microarrays (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McDonald and Rosbash, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Panda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Storch et al., 2002</xref>) and more recently high-throughput sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>). It is generally assumed that these rhythms in mRNA expression directly result from temporal changes in transcription. There are, however, a few reports indicating that post-transcriptional regulation contributes to rhythmic mRNA expression of several genes, including core clock genes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kojima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Staiger and Green, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Staiger and Koster, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), but this has never been studied in detail at the genome-wide level. Circadian post-transcriptional regulation may impact rhythmic mRNA expression at many different levels, such as mRNA splicing, stability and translation. For example, post-transcriptional events rhythmically regulate the mRNA half-life of the mammalian clock genes <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Cry1</italic> and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> clock gene <italic>per</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">So and Rosbash, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Woo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Woo et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, several RNA-binding proteins such as LARK, hnRNP I, hnRNP P, hnRNP Q or the circadian deadenylase NOCTURNIN have been shown to regulate circadian gene expression and/or circadian behavior (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kojima et al., 2011</xref>). These different modes of post-transcriptional regulation are not restricted to circadian biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keene, 2007</xref>) and have been shown in other systems to regulate cellular mRNA levels independent of transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giege et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheadle et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>To address the genome-wide contribution of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation to mammalian mRNA rhythms, we used Nascent-Seq (high-throughput sequencing of nascent RNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khodor et al., 2011</xref>) to assay global rhythmic transcription in mouse liver. We performed a parallel analysis of rhythmic mRNA expression with RNA-Seq and compared the two sequencing datasets. Although many genes are rhythmically transcribed in the mouse liver (&#x223c;15% of all detected genes), only 42% of these rhythmically transcribed genes show mRNA oscillations. More importantly, about 70% of the genes that exhibit rhythmic mRNA expression do not show transcriptional rhythms, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation plays a major role in defining the rhythmic mRNA landscape. To assess the contribution of the core molecular clock to genome-wide transcriptional rhythms, we also examined how rhythmic CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding directly affects the transcription of its target genes. Although maximal binding occurs at an apparently uniform phase, the peak transcriptional phases of CLK:BMAL1 target genes are heterogeneous, which indicates a disconnect between CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding and its transcriptional output. The data taken together reveal novel regulatory features of rhythmic gene expression and highlight Nascent-Seq as an important genome-wide assay for the study of gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide analysis of transcription in the mouse liver using Nascent-Seq</title><p>To address the regulation of genome-wide transcription, we analyzed mouse liver nascent RNA expression, that is, RNA being transcribed by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) prior to 3&#x2032; end formation (from 12 independent samples in LD, 6 time points per day done twice; see analysis of rhythmic transcription in mouse liver section). To this end, nascent RNA was extracted from purified nuclei using the high salt/urea/detergent buffer originally described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wuarin and Schibler (1994)</xref>. A very similar sequencing strategy was recently applied by Smale, Black and colleagues to macrophage nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhatt et al., 2012</xref>). We then prepared illumina libraries with standard protocols for high-throughput sequencing (Nascent-Seq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khodor et al., 2011</xref>). Removal of rRNA was unnecessary as approximately 65&#x2013;70% of the sequences uniquely mapped to the genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Seventy six percent of these uniquely mapped sequences map to introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This contrasts dramatically with more conventional RNA-Seq; it has minimal intron reads as it assays polyadenylated (pA) RNA and therefore predominantly mature (spliced) mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Intronic Nascent-Seq reads are also more abundant in mouse compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic> (76% vs 45%), reflecting longer intron size and less efficient mouse co-transcriptional splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Khodor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khodor et al., 2011</xref>). Many genes exhibit a 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; gradient in the Nascent-Seq dataset, presumably reflecting nascent RNAs of different lengths attached to elongating Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, Nascent-Seq signals frequently extend past the polyadenylation site, reflecting RNA not yet cleaved by the cleavage/polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and/or RNA molecules still associated with Pol II after cleavage but prior to degradation by the 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; exoribonuclease <italic>Xrn2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These features are absent from standard RNA-Seq data, and indicate that Nascent-Seq predominantly detects nascent RNA molecules attached to elongating Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00011.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide assay of transcription in the mouse liver using Nascent-Seq.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>): Distribution of high-throughput sequencing signal within introns (green), exons (blue) and intergenic regions (grey) for Nascent-Seq and RNA-Seq datasets.

Some genes have a high ratio of Nascent-Seq to RNA-Seq signal (e.g., <italic>B4galt1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), whereas others have a low ratio (e.g., <italic>Bag1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Genes with a high ratio (top 10% of all genes) are dramatically enriched for specific functions, namely, non-coding RNA (ncRNA), G-coupled protein receptors, regulation of transcription and chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Genes with a low ratio are enriched for genes involved in ribosome function and mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Because these genes are associated with short or long mRNA half-lives, respectively, we compared the Nascent-Seq to RNA-Seq ratios of genes with their published mRNA half-lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sharova et al., 2009</xref>). Not surprisingly, genes with a high ratio have relatively short half-lives, and genes with low ratios have longer mRNA half-lives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These data indicates that mRNA stability contributes to the wide range of Nascent-Seq to RNA-Seq ratios.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Analysis of rhythmic transcription in mouse liver</title><p>To identify genes that are rhythmically transcribed, we performed two independent six time-points rhythms of mouse liver Nascent-Seq.

The reasoning was that low variability expression between time points should result in a low SD. The SD was noticeably higher in the Nascent-Seq dataset than in the RNA-Seq dataset, indicating that the transcription of most AR-R genes is indeed variable compared to the mRNA-Seq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; note that most points are to the right of the diagonal line). Higher variability of nascent RNA expression is also observed for other categories, including the AR-AR set (data not shown), suggesting that it is a common feature of transcription vs mRNA comparisons independent of circadian considerations.</p><p>Yet a higher variability of transcription (higher SD) correlates with rhythmic mRNA expression within all arrhythmically transcribed genes (n &#x3d; 4632), suggesting that transcriptional variability generally contributes to the generation of rhythmic mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This relationship is independent of nascent RNA expression levels, indicating that the correlation is not due to sequencing depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). More variable transcription is also associated with higher amplitudes of rhythmic mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This correlation is valid for most AR-R genes (&#x223c;80%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting that this transcriptional variability or noise has a significant role in the emergence of rhythmic mRNA expression from arrhythmic transcription.</p><p>A comparison between the two replicates of rhythmic mRNAs indicates a better overlap than between one replicate and one replicate of rhythmic nascent RNAs. In contrast, the overlap between the two replicates of rhythmic nascent RNAs was no better than a single replicate rhythmic nascent RNA-rhythmic mRNA comparison (data not shown). Although the two comparisons cannot be definitive because of the limited six time point temporal resolution and resultant noise, they also support more pronounced variation at the transcriptional level than at the mRNA level.</p><p>Manual inspection of AR-R genes with high variability revealed a set of genes with high transcription at only one time point (10% of the AR-R gene set; 86/862). This was observed in both replicates and also correlates with rhythmic mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). mRNA stability (half-life) regulation may contribute to the generation of rhythmic mRNA expression from what is likely a short burst of transcription. This ability of post-transcriptional regulation to generate rhythmic mRNA oscillations is selective, as not all arrhythmically transcribed genes with variable transcription exhibit rhythmic mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Moreover, not all genes exhibit variable transcriptional profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, see below).</p><p>About 20% of the AR-R genes are exceptions and exhibit higher variability at the mRNA than at the nascent level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,F</xref>). Because there is evidence that miRNAs can regulate mRNA levels independently of transcription, we examined whether those genes could be preferentially linked to miRNA regulation. Indeed, a higher number of predicted miRNA target sites was found for these genes compared to genes with higher transcriptional variability (using MirTarget2; p&#x3c;0.01), suggesting that miRNAs contribute to mRNA cycling of genes with low transcriptional variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).</p><p>The separation of these AR-R genes between genes with high or low transcriptional variability is therefore likely to be linked to different modes of gene expression regulation. Interestingly, this separation also reflects distinct biological functions, as AR-R genes with highly variable transcription were enriched for responsive genes (GO: response to stimulus) and metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), indicating that their intrinsic transcriptional responsiveness is linked to their variable transcriptional profiles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Regulation of transcription by CLK:BMAL1</title><p>Genes within the R-R gene set include clock genes and many well-characterized clock controlled genes (see above). Because a large fraction of them are directly targeted by the core clock, we asked how CLK:BMAL1 regulates the transcription of its target genes at the genome-wide level. We also took advantage of our Nascent-Seq dataset to establish whether the phase differences between rhythmic CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding and rhythmic target gene mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rey et al., 2011</xref>) reflect transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation.</p><p>To this end, we first performed a ChIP-Seq analysis of CLK and BMAL1 at a time of high DNA binding (ZT8).

However, the application here of Nascent-Seq to genome-wide mouse liver transcriptional rhythms indicates that about 70% of the genes that exhibit rhythmic mRNA expression do not have robust transcriptional rhythms (AR-R category), suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms are important for the generation of robust mRNA rhythms. Yet the transcription of most AR-R genes is variable, with elevated levels coinciding with the peak of the rhythmic mRNA profile. This suggests that post-transcriptional events buffer variable transcriptional output to generate robust and reproducible rhythms of mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). A similar Nascent-Seq vs RNA-Seq strategy for <italic>Drosophila</italic> head RNA (Joe Rodriguez and Michael Rosbash, personal communication) and a very recently published paper based on a different strategy for assessing liver transcriptional rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koike et al., 2012</xref>) come to a generally similar conclusion, namely, a widespread contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to circadian mRNA cycling.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00011.021</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Post-transcriptional events contribute to rhythmic mRNA expression in the mouse liver.</title><p>Although rhythmic transcription plays a major role for approximately 30% of the genes that exhibit rhythmic mRNA expression, post-transcriptional events significantly contribute to the generation of mRNA rhythms for the majority of genes (&#x223c;70%). Many post-transcriptional cyclers exhibit highly variable transcription that is buffered to generate robust rhythmic mRNA expression. Few genes exhibit a relatively constant transcription when compared to mRNA expression. These post-transcriptional events may include roles for RNA binding proteins and miRNAs to regulate RNA stability, 3&#x2032; end formation and nuclei export.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00011.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00011.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="elife00011f009"/></fig></p><p>Relevant mechanisms likely include RNA stability as well as other RNA processing events, as suggested in other systems such as the regulation of gene expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giege et al., 2000</xref>) and after T-cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheadle et al., 2005</xref>). Because the half-lives of nascent transcripts are generally much shorter than those of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Griffiths-Jones, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mattick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mercer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang and Chang, 2011</xref>), a short burst of transcription can result in elevated mRNA expression that lasts several hours, as has been shown in systems involving an acute inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheadle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hao and Baltimore, 2009</xref>). However, generic mRNA stability cannot account for this buffering, as many genes with arrhythmic but variable transcription do not exhibit rhythmic mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). This suggests that the post-transcriptional buffering is clock-controlled and selective for specific genes.</p><p>Because our experiments were done under LD conditions, it is possible that some cycling RNAs and mechanisms are not circadian but driven by the LD cycle. Nonetheless, it is likely that many of them also occur under DD conditions and that specific and perhaps multiple post-transcriptional mechanisms contribute to rhythmic mRNA expression. They may include 3&#x2032; end formation and coupled polyadenylation, splicing, mRNA export as well as cytoplasmic events involving translation, RNA binding proteins (RBP) and miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Joshi et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, a few recent reports highlight the tight coupling between transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional events that govern mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bregman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trcek et al., 2011</xref>). In these examples, RBPs are recruited by specific transcription factors, which then help load the RBPs onto nascent RNA; they then control cytoplasmic mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bregman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trcek et al., 2011</xref>). A mechanism of this nature could account for the post-transcriptional generation of rhythmic mRNA expression.</p><p>The AR-R genes with high transcriptional variability are enriched for metabolic functions as well as those involved in &#x2018;response to stimulus&#x2019;. The transcription of many metabolic genes is regulated by metabolites and/or hormones (e.g., transcription of Sds is induced by glucagon and CREB, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haas and Pitot, 1999</xref>). A large fraction of rhythmic mRNAs may therefore result from a transcriptional response, dependent on the cellular environment, as well as post-transcriptional events that stabilize mRNA at an appropriate time of the day. This scenario could also explain the R-AR gene set: despite rhythmic transcription, the lack of rhythmic post-transcriptional regulation would negate the transcriptional oscillations.</p><p>Importantly, many genes with rhythmic mRNA expression also exhibit robust transcriptional rhythms. They include all well-known clock genes and many well-characterized clock-controlled genes (see above). Their transcriptional profiles suggest that they are under more stringent transcriptional control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), due perhaps to direct regulation by the core clock in combination with additional transcription factors.</p><p>Our genome-wide characterization of rhythmic transcription also allowed us to directly assay how the rhythmic binding of CLK:BMAL1 to its target gene promoters correlates with transcription. The transcriptional phase of these target genes is heterogeneous and distributed throughout the day, despite a more discrete phase of BMAL1 DNA binding at the beginning of the light phase. This indicates that transcriptional output is not identical for all target genes and suggests that CLK:BMAL1 cooperates with other transcription factors to establish the phase of transcription, as previously shown only for the <italic>Cry1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ukai-Tadenuma et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, transcription of most of these target genes is arrhythmic but not absent without BMAL1. This feature of target gene expression as well as the heterogeneity of phase is unlike what is observed in flies: core CLK:CYC target genes exhibit a discrete phase of expression that matches the phase of DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abruzzi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the application of Nascent-Seq and RNA-Seq to mammalian circadian gene expression regulation challenges two assumptions of the mammalian circadian field. The first is that rhythmic transcriptional regulation is sufficient to describe the cycling gene expression landscape. The second is that CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding alone sets the phase of, and is essential for, core clock gene transcription. The dramatic, genome-wide disconnect between the phases of rhythmic CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding and rhythmic target gene transcription suggests that other transcription factors and/or mechanisms collaborate with CLK:BMAL1 binding and are critical to determine the phase of clock gene transcription. We anticipate that Nascent-Seq will impact gene expression regulation far beyond the circadian applications shown here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>3- to 6-month-old male mice housed in a 12 hr-light:12 hr-darkness (LD12:12) schedule were used.

id="s4-8-1"><title>Alignment to the mouse genome (mm9 version)</title><p>Sequences (fastq format) were first mapped with tophat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>) using the following criteria: -m 1 -g 1 --microexonsearch --no-closure-search -I 500000 (command line: tophat -m 1 -F 0 -g 1 --microexon-search --no-closure-search -G ../exon20110528mm.gtf --phred64-quals

About 65&#x2013;70% of the Nascent-Seq sequences uniquely mapped to the mouse genome, even though no rRNA removal has been performed. Uniquely mapped sequences from the tophat output files (bam format) were then used for further analysis. Wig files, used for signal visualization with the Integrated Genome Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nicol et al., 2009</xref>), were created as described in UCSC website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/apache/htdocs-rr/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html">ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/apache/htdocs-rr/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html</ext-link>) and normalized to uniquely mapped reads. The normalization factor used for normalization is indicated in the last column of the <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Quantification of gene signal</title><p>Quantification of nascent RNA and mRNA signal has been calculated from the Nascent-Seq and RNA-Seq datasets using custom-written perl and mysql scripts (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Source code 1</xref>). No quantification was performed using the strand-specific Nascent-Seq datasets. To allow direct comparison between the Nascent-Seq and RNA-Seq datasets, and because many genes have another gene coding for non-coding RNA expressed within their introns (e.g., <italic>Camk2b</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), the gene signal was calculated by only considering the sequences mapping to exons. Moreover, because &#x2018;only&#x2019; approximately 13% of the Nascent-Seq signal is mapped to exons (most of the signal is intronic), we reached a higher sequencing depth for the Nascent-Seq samples (&#x3e;15,000,000 uniquely mapped sequences for all samples, representing a minimum of 160,000,000 nucleotides mapping to the transcriptome).</p><p>To allow comparison between the Nascent-Seq and RNA-Seq datasets, individual gene signal was quantitated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>) by calculating the number of reads mapping to all exons (regardless of the isoforms) and by normalizing this number to the total exon length (hence the signal was called Reads per Base Pair, or rpbp). This rpbp number was then normalized to the sample sequencing depth (uniquely mapped sequences) and used for further analysis (see below).</p><p>Determination of rpbp threshold: the rpbp threshold has been determined so that the difference in gene signal reflects biological variation rather than low sequencing depth. To this end, we took advantage of libraries sequenced on two independent flow-cell lanes and with a similar number of sequences in each lane (e.g., Nascent-Seq, replicate 1, ZT8; 19,207,641 and 20,364,883 sequences respectively).</p><p>We first assayed the correlation between gene signals of the two duplicates: the correlation is very good for high values of rpbp, and progressively decreases as the rpbp decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The variation of gene signal that results from low sequencing depth was then determined by calculating the standard deviation to the mean (z-score) for every gene between the two duplicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). As expected, the z-score is low for high rpbp and increases with lower gene signal, reflecting a progressive decrease of sequencing depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of this variation allowed us to determine the rpbp threshold. Indeed, among genes with a rpbp superior to 2, less than 6.7% display a variation of more than 1.3-fold between the two duplicates (432/6486) and only 88 genes (1.36%) display a variation of more than 1.5-fold (88/6486; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, the majority of these genes are relatively short (&#x3c;1 kb), hence contributing for some of the variability. This analysis therefore indicates that a rpbp of 2&#x2013;3 (for datasets with &#x223c;20,000,000 uniquely mapped sequences of 80 nt) can be used as a threshold to detect biological variation of nascent RNA expression.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00011.023</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Determination of the rpbp threshold for the Nascent-Seq dataset</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00011.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00011.023</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="2">Fold difference</td><td colspan="2">Rpbp &#x3e; 3</td><td colspan="2">Rpbp &#x3e; 2.6786</td><td colspan="2">Rpbp &#x3e; 2</td></tr><tr><td>&#x23; Genes</td><td>% Genes</td><td>&#x23; Genes</td><td>% Genes</td><td>&#x23; Genes</td><td>% Genes</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&#x3e;2</td><td align="char" char=".">0</td><td align="char" char=".">0.00</td><td align="char" char=".">0</td><td align="char" char=".">0.00</td><td align="char" char=".">2</td><td align="char" char=".">0.03</td></tr><tr><td>&#x3e;1.5</td><td align="char" char=".">32</td><td align="char" char=".">0.77</td><td align="char" char=".">44</td><td align="char" char=".">0.93</td><td align="char" char=".">88</td><td align="char" char=".">1.36</td></tr><tr><td>&#x3e;1.4</td><td align="char" char=".">67</td><td align="char" char=".">1.61</td><td align="char" char=".">93</td><td align="char" char=".">1.97</td><td align="char" char=".">180</td><td align="char" char=".">2.78</td></tr><tr><td>&#x3e;1.3</td><td align="char" char=".">169</td><td align="char" char=".">4.06</td><td align="char" char=".">224</td><td align="char" char=".">4.74</td><td align="char" char=".">432</td><td align="char" char=".">6.66</td></tr><tr><td>&#x3e;1.2</td><td align="char" char=".">543</td><td align="char" char=".">13.06</td><td align="char" char=".">689</td><td align="char" char=".">14.57</td><td align="char" char=".">1159</td><td align="char" char=".">17.87</td></tr><tr><td>&#x3e;1.1</td><td align="char" char=".">1698</td><td align="char" char=".">40.83</td><td align="char" char=".">2015</td><td align="char" char=".">42.62</td><td align="char" char=".">3012</td><td align="char" char=".">46.44</td></tr><tr><td>1.0&#x2013;1.1</td><td align="char" char=".">2461</td><td align="char" char=".">59.17</td><td align="char" char=".">2713</td><td align="char" char=".">57.38</td><td align="char" char=".">3474</td><td align="char" char=".">53.56</td></tr><tr><td>Total &#x23; genes</td><td align="char" char=".">4159</td><td/><td align="char" char=".">4728</td><td/><td align="char" char=".">6486</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Because of Nascent-Seq datsets were normalized to 40,000,000 reads, we used to threshold of 6 rpbp, as it corresponds to a rpbp of 2.6786 for the Nascent-Seq samples with the least coverage (ZT12, replicate 2).

Briefly, a peak located between the transcription start site and the transcription start end of a gene was assigned to that gene, regardless of the ChIP-Seq peak position. The other peaks, referred as intergenic, were assigned to the gene with the closest transcription start site. Confirmation of this computational gene assignment was then confirmed by manual inspection for the 211 CLK:BMAL1 peaks.

Quantification of the signal has been extracted from the raw data (number of reads per bp) normalized to sequencing depth of each library.

GO analysis has been performed using GOToolBox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin et al., 2004</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.crg.es/GOToolBox/">http://genome.crg.es/GOToolBox/</ext-link>), using an hypergeometric test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. The background model consisted of the entire list of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis of rhythmic gene expression</title><p>Only genes with more than three reads per base pair for at least one time point of the Nascent-Seq dataset and two read per base pair for the RNA-Seq dataset were further considered for subsequent analysis (see above). Rhythmically expressed genes were determined based on three parameters: amplitude, F24 (24-hr spectral power, see below) and p-value of the F24.</p><p>The amplitude was calculated by dividing the highest value of the 12 time points by the lowest value. The F24 score was calculated by Fourier transformation using a R code originally described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wijnen et al. (2005)</xref>. Briefly, normalized reads per base pair from the two independent six-time points rhythms were concatenated and the 24-hr spectral power (F24) was determined for each gene. The F24 score (expressed in range 0&#x2013;1) indicates the relative strength of the extracted rhythmic component.</p><p>The F24 p-value (pF24) represents the probability of observing an F24 score from randomly permuted data that is of equal or greater strength than the extracted Fourier component. It was calculated for each gene after performing 10,000 randomized permutations of the rpbp values. A pF24 was considered significant if (pF24 &#x3c; 0.05) if the experimental pF24 was within the top 5% of the 10,000 pF24 calculated from randomized permutation.</p><p>Transcripts were considered to be rhythmically expressed when meeting the three following criteria: (1) pF24-values &#x3c; 0.05 (i.e., experimental pF24-value is within the top 5% of the 10,000 pF24-values calculated from randomized permutation), (2) F24 &#x3e; 0.45 and (3) amplitude (maximal/minimal experimental values) &#x3e; 1.5. A more stringent cut-off was also used to identify strong rhythmic expression: pF24 &#x3c; 0.05, F24 &#x3e; 0.6 and amplitude &#x3e; 1.75.</p><p>The phase information from the Fourier transformation (which indicates the peak of the cosine curve) was further used to assess phase difference between rhythmic nascent RNA and mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3C,4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of gene expression by real-time PCR</title><p>Total RNA from wild-type and <italic>Bmal1&#x2212;/&#x2212;</italic> mice was prepared from mouse liver using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and DNAse-treated using Turbo DNAse (Ambion) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s protocols. cDNA derived from RNA (using Invitrogen Superscript II and random primers) was utilized as a template for quantitative real-time PCR performed with the Rotor-Gene 3000 real-time cycler (Qiagen). The PCR mixture contained Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), optimized concentrations of Sybr-green (Invitrogen) and specific primers for either <italic>Rev-Erb&#x3b1;</italic>, <italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic> or <italic>Cry1</italic> pre-mRNAs. Quantitative PCR using <italic>Actg1</italic>-specific primers was used as a loading control. Cycling parameters were 95&#xb0;C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95&#xb0;C for 30 s, 55&#xb0;C for 45 s, and 72&#xb0;C for 45 s. Fluorescence intensities were plotted vs the number of cycles by using an algorithm provided by the manufacturer. mRNA levels were quantified using a calibration curve based upon dilution of concentrated cDNA.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Chris Bradfield (University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States) for providing the <italic>Bmal11&#x2212;/&#x2212;</italic> mice and the Brandeis University Transgenic Animal Facility for help at various stages of this project.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of <italic>eLife&#x27;s</italic> Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Senior Editor (Detlef Weigel), the Reviewing Editor (Todd Mockler) and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers&#x27; reports. Our goal is to provide the essential revision requirements as a single set of instructions, so that you have a clear view of the revisions that are necessary for us to publish your work.</p><p><bold>General assessment:</bold></p><p>Your data suggest that the circadian oscillation of mRNA transcription is only partly controlled by the transcriptional regulatory machinery, which is in contrast to what is currently accepted in the field. Your manuscript therefore addresses an important problem in circadian biology: what is the correlation between transcription and the mRNA levels measured by high-throughput techniques? In various organisms and tissues the cycling transcripts have been identified, however, the link between these stable mRNA measures, transcriptional activity, and post-transcriptional regulation has not been addressed on a global scale. The reviewers agreed that the principles behind the experiments are generally sound, that the manuscript is well written, and that with a few exceptions the experimental protocols and analysis methods are clear. This paper provides several key advancements in the field and provides a solid foundation upon which to build a better understanding of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and the contribution of post-transcriptional mechanisms to clock regulated gene expression.</p><p><bold>Major concerns:</bold></p><p>Several concerns relate to establishing whether the findings arising from the Nascent-Seq and mRNA-seq comparisons reflect genuine biological differences or are a technical artifact from comparing two different methods:</p><p>It is difficult to evaluate the conclusions drawn from the nascent Seq, mRNA-seq, and ChIP-seq experiments without knowing how much Illumina read data was acquired for each sample, and what the read mapping statistics were for each sample. Carefully describing the amount and types of sequence data is essential for interpretation and needs to be presented in the manuscript so that the reader can confirm that the conclusions are based on genuine biological phenomena. Also, you used strand-specific libraries for some of the experiments, but it is not clear in which ones, and if this could affect the analysis. Please provide this information, which can be presented in an additional table. How many genes were expressed in each sample (i.e. detected in the sequence data given some threshold of minimal expression) in the nascent Seq and mRNA-seq experiments needs to be given as well, as this will be a further measure of whether the depth of sequencing achieved for each sample was adequate.</p><p>A second question is whether the quantification method affect the variance. Is the read per base pair value adjusted for the total number of reads? If not, differences in sequencing depth could contribute to differences in variance. Further, the number of introns and extended regions in the nascent RNA data could affect the proportion of exonic sequence being sampled, biasing the sensitivity of the read per base pair measure. Appropriate normalization would contribute to ensuring the comparisons are as even as possible.</p><p>The comparison of mRNA levels in the same tissue from different labs has also resulted in non-overlapping sets of rhythmic transcripts. Is any of the difference in nascent RNA and mRNA levels from intrinsic biological variation or from the limitations of quantifying these molecules? How consistent are the mRNA and nascent RNA timecourses compared to themselves (e.g. the 6 samples of mRNA to the other 6 samples of mRNA). Since this will not provide sufficient resolution, other techniques to establish the similarity of the data sets can be used. What is the overlap with rhythmic data from other labs (using the same algorithms)?</p><p>There are several new comparisons and analysis methods described in this paper. It is essential that the approaches and analysis methods employed on this novel data are clearly explained and accessible to the community so that the experiments can be applied to other systems and comparisons with this work made. The description of the analysis methods provided in the materials and methods need to be detailed and where &#x201C;custom scripts&#x201D; are used, these scripts need to be made available.</p><p>Cycling nascent RNA and mRNA was compared with a time course from the livers of mice housed in 12:12 LD. Interpretation is hindered by use of a cycling light/dark cycle as it is impossible to distinguish which rhythms are truly circadian and which are light driven; collections in constant darkness would have been preferable. While the data presented is still compelling, this potential confounding factor needs to be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Comparison of rhythmic nascent RNA and mRNA (R-R) showed a weak overlap between the two data sets (only 41.6% of na-RNAs were also rhythmic at the mRNA level). However, it is unclear how this percentage was reached as the ratio of 342 (strong rhythmic nascent RNA) to 822 (total rhythmic nascent RNA) was used, but the authors indicate that 342 is representative of &#x201C;rhythmically transcribed genes&#x201D; (and suggest all cycling nascent RNA) whereas 842 represents &#x201C;rhythmic RNA expression&#x201D; (lines 114-116). Based on the figures provided, it is unclear how these numbers were obtained and further clarification is needed. A 28.4% overlap of oscillating Na-RNA and total mRNA (342/1204) was shown, which suggests a high amount of cycling mRNAs undergo post-transcriptional regulation that is critical for rhythmicity. However, it is unclear why only the strongly rhythmic nascent RNAs were used (342) instead of all cycling Na-RNAs (842) and this should be explained more clearly.</p><p><bold>Summary:</bold></p><p>The major issues the review team would like to see addressed relate to read depth, normalization and comparison methods, and improved descriptions of the methods to better explain how the data was processed and analyzed (for example, better explanations of key ratios used in data interpretation). The results of this study are very exciting, but it is important for the authors to convince the reader that the results reflect a genuine biological difference and do not reflect a technical artifact from comparing two different methods. The review team hopes your manuscript will be able to move forward with improved analysis and better explanation of this analysis, without the need for new data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00011.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Several concerns relate to establishing whether the findings arising from the Nascent-Seq and mRNA-seq comparisons reflect genuine biological differences or are a technical artifact from comparing two different methods</italic>:</p><p>To address this concern, we have included a detailed description of the methods/analysis used in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>It is difficult to evaluate the conclusions drawn from the nascent Seq, mRNA-seq, and ChIP-seq experiments without knowing how much Illumina read data was acquired for each sample, and what the read mapping statistics were for each sample.

Also, you used strand-specific libraries for some of the experiments, but it is not clear in which ones, and if this could affect the analysis. Please provide this information, which can be presented in an additional table (point &#x23;2). How many genes were expressed in each sample (i.e. detected in the sequence data given some threshold of minimal expression) in the nascent Seq and mRNA-seq experiments needs to be given as well, as this will be a further measure of whether the depth of sequencing achieved for each sample was adequate (point &#x23;3)</italic>.</p><p>Point &#x23;1: The detailed information about the number of reads acquired for each sample and the read mapping statistics are now provided (see the Materials and methods).</p><p>Point &#x23;2: We clarified how and when we used the strand-specific data. Briefly, we only used them for visualization purposes, that is to assess whether antisense transcription within some transcription units may be relevant for the Nascent-Seq profile (e.g., <italic>Per2</italic>, see Figure 5F). No quantification/analysis of gene signal has been performed using the strand-specific datasets.</p><p>Point &#x23;3: The information about the number of genes expressed in each sample is now provided in the expanded Materials and methods. Moreover, we now provide the Nascent-Seq and RNA-Seq signal for every gene and every sample. Because all samples have substantial read coverage, a minimum of 160,000,000 nucleotides per sample mapped to the transcriptome, this corresponds to an average of 2.5 reads/bp for all transcripts.</p><p><italic>A second question is whether the quantification method affect the variance. Is the read per base pair value adjusted for the total number of reads? If not, differences in sequencing depth could contribute to differences in variance (point &#x23;1). Further, the number of introns and extended regions in the nascent RNA data could affect the proportion of exonic sequence being sampled, biasing the sensitivity of the read per base pair measure. Appropriate normalization would contribute to ensuring the comparisons are as even as possible (point &#x23;2)</italic>.</p><p>Point &#x23;1: The reads per base pair (rpbp) value was adjusted to the total number of reads. This is now stated and explained in the manuscript.</p><p>Point &#x23;2: As mentioned in the expanded Materials and methods, we required a higher sequencing depth for the Nascent-Seq data than for the RNA-Seq for this exact reason, i.e., less exonic signal in Nascent-Seq data. Moreover, the rpbp threshold was determined by comparing the rpbp values of a single library sequenced in parallel in two lanes. The comparison is now explained in detail. Briefly, it allowed us to determine a rpbp threshold for which there was minimal variability between the two lanes of sequencing.</p><p>For comparisons of rpbp signal between the Nascent-Seq and RNA-Seq data, we only compared the ratio Nascent-Seq rpbp/RNA-Seq rpbp for only the exons of every gene. So this makes intron signal irrelevant except for the requirement for more sequencing depth.</p><p><italic>The comparison of mRNA levels in the same tissue from different labs has also resulted in non-overlapping sets of rhythmic transcripts. Is any of the difference in nascent RNA and mRNA levels from intrinsic biological variation or from the limitations of quantifying these molecules? How consistent are the mRNA and nascent RNA timecourses compared to themselves (e.g. the 6 samples of mRNA to the other 6 samples of mRNA). Since this will not provide sufficient resolution, other techniques to establish the similarity of the data sets can be used. What is the overlap with rhythmic data from other labs (using the same algorithms)</italic>?</p><p>We are aware of these important issues. Although they are complicated, our sequencing depth and methodological strategies are covered elsewhere in these answers. What has not been mentioned, however, are the robust and highly reproducible rhythmic profiles of the clock genes. This argues against major and systematic methodological problems as the sole cause of transcriptional variability, consistent with bona fide variability for some genes and not for others (a conclusion of our paper).</p><p>With respect to data from other labs, the non-overlapping set of mRNAs found by different lab also results to some extent from the use of different statistical methods to analyze the data. Our study uses the same pipeline for the entire analysis of rhythmic gene expression. Other possible reasons are differences in mouse strains, how animals are raised, their manipulation, the food, etc. Because all our experiments were done with the same mice in the same facility and performed by the same experimenter (J.S.M), the mRNA vs Nascent RNA comparisons cannot suffer from these issues.</p><p>In response to the reviewers&#x2019; suggestion, we performed a comparison between the two independent replicates. Although the analysis cannot be completely meaningful/quantitative because of the limited six time point temporal resolution and resultant noise (as anticipated by the reviewers), it shows better overlap between the two RNA-Seq datasets than between a single RNA-Seq and a single Nascent-Seq dataset. In contrast, the overlap between the two Nascent- Seq datasets was no better than the Nascent-Seq/RNA-Seq data comparison, supporting more pronounced variation at the transcriptional level than at the mRNA level. This is indeed a major conclusion reached in our manuscript. A statement summarizing these new comparisons (thanks to this reviewer for the suggestion) has been added to the paper.</p><p>The other suggested comparison is limited by the lack of any published RNA-Seq dataset that address rhythmic gene expression in the mouse liver. However, we did carefully compare our data with an existing microarray dataset (e.g., Kornmann et al., 2006). We used our analytical methods to identify cycling mRNAs in the dataset. We chose this study because it used the same paradigm, e.g., 2 independent 6-time points rhythms in LD. Although the comparison is of limited value because of the many technical differences, i.e., quality of the microarray probes, different probes for one single gene that result in different rhythmic output etc, those cycling mRNAs match better our RNA-Seq dataset than our Nascent-Seq dataset, consistent again with the results reported in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>There are several new comparisons and analysis methods described in this paper. It is essential that the approaches and analysis methods employed on this novel data are clearly explained and accessible to the community so that the experiments can be applied to other systems and comparisons with this work made. The description of the analysis methods provided in the materials and methods need to be detailed and where &#x201C;custom scripts&#x201D; are used, these scripts need to be made available</italic>.</p><p>The new Materials and methods section should solve this problem. Importantly, the scripts used to calculate RNA expression levels are available as a supplementary file.</p><p><italic>Cycling nascent RNA and mRNA was compared with a time course from the livers of mice housed in 12:12 LD.

However, it is unclear how this percentage was reached as the ratio of 342 (strong rhythmic nascent RNA) to 822 (total rhythmic nascent RNA) was used, but the authors indicate that 342 is representative of &#x201C;rhythmically transcribed genes&#x201D; (and suggest all cycling nascent RNA) whereas 842 represents &#x201C;rhythmic RNA expression&#x201D; (lines 114-116). Based on the figures provided, it is unclear how these numbers were obtained and further clarification is needed. A 28.4% overlap of oscillating Na-RNA and total mRNA (342/1204) was shown, which suggests a high amount of cycling mRNAs undergo post- transcriptional regulation that is critical for rhythmicity. However, it is unclear why only the strongly rhythmic nascent RNAs were used (342) instead of all cycling Na-RNAs (842) and this should be explained more clearly</italic>.</p><p>This issue has been clarified in the revised version of the manuscript. It includes all these numbers mentioned above by the reviewers. It also looks like this confusion comes from the number 342, which is the number of genes with strong rhythmic Nascent-Seq expression (as shown in Figure 3A) but coincidentally also the number of genes in the R-R category (as described in the text).</p></body></sub-article></article>
