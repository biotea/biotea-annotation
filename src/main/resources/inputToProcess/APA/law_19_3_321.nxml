<p align="left">Concern over rising obesity levels in Western nations is reflected in recent governmental interest in policy-level initiatives to tackle this. The present study aimed to enhance our understanding of how people respond to policies that are introduced to influence their behavior by exploring the association between people's support for policy and beliefs surrounding its efficacy and their motivation toward controlling their own weight. The study used the framework of self-determination theory to explore the association between policy- and individual-level effects. Data were collected from 188 U.K. participants (42% male, 95% white, 50% overweight, and 74% actively trying to control their weight). Measures included beliefs regarding obesity causality and severity, perceived societal pressure to be thin, support for obesity-related policies, motivation for weight loss behaviors, and objectively measured weight. Levels of support were similar for overweight and nonoverweight participants. The majority of people (75.5%) actively supported obesity-related polices, and reported significantly greater support for redistributive and compensatory policies (76.6% in both cases) than for price raising policies (43.6%). Policy support was predicted by perceived societal pressure to be thin (<italic>R</italic><sup location="post">2</sup> = .09). Greater support for obesity-related policies significantly predicted controlled, but not autonomous, motivation toward weight loss behaviors (<italic>R</italic><sup location="post">2</sup> = 0.14). The findings suggest that while obesity-related policy intervention in the U.K. is largely considered legitimate it does not promote autonomous, and by implication lasting, motivation for individuals to engage in weight control behaviors.</p>

<p align="left">Obesity has been identified as a global health epidemic. In 2008 the World Health Organization estimated 1.4 billion adults worldwide were classed as overweight and 500 million of these obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-1" rid="c68">WHO, 2008</xref>). Westernized nations show the highest obesity rates, for example in the U.K. more than half of adults are classed as overweight and a quarter as obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">National Health Service, 2010</xref>) with these figures set to rise. Obesity increases the risk of many noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and musculoskeletal disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Bray, 2004</xref>) and increases disability in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Mayhew, Richardson, &amp; Rickayzen, 2009</xref>). As such, investigating how obesity prevention and management initiative can be more effectively delivered is extremely important (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Chan &amp; Woo, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Many approaches to the prevention and treatment of obesity are targeted at the level of the individual, for example through developing medical (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Colquitt, Picot, Loveman &amp; Clegg, 2009</xref>) or behavior change interventions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Shaw, O'Rourke, Del Mar &amp; Kenardy, 2005</xref>). However, although providing support and encouragement for individuals to change their behavior is no doubt important, the social (e.g., family, peer and cultural influences) and/or built environment (e.g., presence of parks, food outlets, perceived safety) in which people live also significantly impact obesity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Papas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">McNeill, Kreuter &amp; Subramanian, 2006</xref>). As such, it is argued that it is the interaction between an individual and their environment that is fundamental to explaining, and therefore tackling, the rise in obesity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Bouchard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1" rid="c53">Wardle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Foresight, 2007</xref>). To do this requires intervention at a policy level (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Swinburn, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Successful policy approaches in other health domains (e.g., tobacco control) suggest that a multidimensional approach is most effective in changing behavior, through targeting different determinants of target behaviors and promoting change in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-1" rid="c57">West, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-1" rid="c63">Yach, McKee, Lopez &amp; Novotny, 2005</xref>). However, there are inherent differences in factors driving the behaviors that contribute to obesity (i.e., diet and physical activity) which have an ongoing role in a person's life, whatever their weight, compared with discrete health risk behaviors such as smoking and alcohol misuse. More work is required to explore whether and which policy approaches are successfully transferable across health domains and to investigate which the public will find acceptable and will subsequently support. Support from the public has emerged as an important element of policy development by helping to conceptualize issues and encourage policymakers to implement new strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Rayens et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, research in other health domains suggests that public support determines people's reactions to a policy, including their willingness for long-term engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Room, Graves, Giesbrecht &amp; Greenfield, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Giesbrecht &amp; Kavanagh, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">There is little consistency in past work investigating what influences obesity policy support. One of the first studies to examine public attitudes toward obesity and obesity policy in the United States, by conducting telephone interviews with 909 adult participants, found that having external health attributions (i.e., believing ones health in general is outside ones control), and believing policy intervention to have been effective for other health behaviors (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption) predicted higher support for obesity-related policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Oliver &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>). Another leading U.S. study sought to identify factors that shape attitudes toward obesity policies using a large Web-sample survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">Barry, Brescoll, Brownell &amp; Schlesinger, 2009</xref>). This study found that beliefs about the causes of obesity relate to public support of policy; that is, support is higher among those who believe obesity is caused by the environment rather than the individual. Further investigation has found that people are also more willing to back a policy if they agree that a topic is important and will be of personal benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Carlson et al., 2011</xref>), but less likely to support it if it is perceived to negatively influence their desired lifestyle; for example, people who smoke more are less likely to support policies surrounding tobacco control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Gardner &amp; West, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">Rosenberg, Pettigrew, Wood, Ferguson &amp; Houghton, 2012</xref>). Similarly, in the obesity field, overweight and obese individuals generally show lower support for obesity policies than healthy weight individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-2" rid="c2">Barry et al., 2009</xref>). However, predicting likely support for a policy before it is implemented is problematic because people do not accurately predict how their preferences will change over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Promberger, 2009</xref>) and commonly change their attitudes once the legislation is in place; for example, support for smoke-free legislation in Ireland increased from 43% to 83% after its introduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">Fong et al., 2006</xref>). As such, conducting research to better understand the link between attitudes, policy support, and likely behavioral responses is very important.</p>
<p align="left">One factor that has a clear relationship to behavioral outcomes and may be useful in understanding this link is a person's motivation. Self-determination theory (SDT; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1991</xref>) provides a framework for exploring how policy level factors can influence motivation through the policy's impact on the social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Moller, Ryan &amp; Deci, 2006</xref>). SDT centers on how an individual experiences their social environment in terms of the degree to which they feel controlled or supported by it to act in ways that are consistent with their own views and preferences. Autonomous forms of motivation are predicted to result from environments that support choice and a sense of personal agency (e.g., the choice to opt in to a particular health scheme) and controlled forms of motivation from environments that undermine choice and exert pressure to behave in certain ways (e.g., as speeding fines or tax on cigarettes). Research has shown that acting through autonomous motivation is associated with better behavioral persistence, enjoyment, and well-being than when feeling controlled by others or a wider society or culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000a</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">From an SDT perspective, motivation for health behaviors has typically been studied at the individual or group level. In these cases, autonomy support is associated with better long-term outcomes in doctor-patient relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-1" rid="c58">Williams, 2002</xref>), in exercise class settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Edmunds, Ntoumanis &amp; Duda, 2006</xref>), and in the receipt of health promotion information and advice (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr60-1" rid="c60">Williams, McGregor, Zeldman, Freedman &amp; Deci, 2004</xref>; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-1" rid="c61">Williams &amp; French, 2011</xref>). Although little intervention research at a policy-level has been conducted explicitly testing/applying SDT, an indication that this framework is applicable can be gained from observational research in the work place; a number of studies have shown that autonomy supportive social climates are related to positive outcomes at an organizational level (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-1" rid="c66">Burstyn, Jonasi, &amp; Wild, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-1" rid="c67">Philippe &amp; Vallerand 2008</xref>),. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-2" rid="c66">Burstyn et al. (2010)</xref> reported on the outcome of autonomy-supportive (i.e., presenting rationales and giving employees choice), versus controlling (i.e., pressurized, authoritarian) approaches to conflict resolution in the management of health and safety inspectors, confirming compliance with health and safety regulations (verified through objective administrative records) was more quickly and collaboratively achieved through a policy supportive of autonomy, than was achieved through more controlling enforcement approaches. In the health care sector, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-2" rid="c67">Philippe and Vallerand (2008)</xref> assessed patients' perceptions of autonomy support generated by nurses across 11 nursing homes, and reported that supportive environments (i.e., opportunities to lead decision making regarding care and daily activities) were associated with positive patient adjustment, and autonomous motivation in major life domains.</p>
<p align="left">Extending this one step further, the social environment beyond a person's immediate home or work environment can also exert strong influences on perceptions of control and motivation; as shown, for example, by the pervasiveness of perceived social pressure from the media and wider society to conform to a thin ideal body type and its documented links to day to day behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1" rid="c54">Wardle, Waller &amp; Fox, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Mask &amp; Blanchard, 2011</xref>). It is at this global, societal level that social policies act. As such, past work from an SDT perspective can contribute to our understanding of how the content of a policy and the way in which it is presented may influence motivation, namely through the degree to which people perceive it to exert control over their behavior or support their autonomy in making the changes that they would like to make (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-2" rid="c30">Moller et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Past work conducted from an SDT perspective shows how outwardly controlling environments can be internalized (i.e., people come to accept environmental controls, feeling autonomous in complying with them) if a meaningful rationale is presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Reeve, Jang, Hardre &amp; Omura, 2002</xref>). For example, although the law requiring people to wear seatbelts is punitive, people can understand and appreciate that it has been imposed to save lives and therefore can feel autonomous in complying with it (they agree with its aims, and therefore chose to change their behavior in line with the policy). Similarly, it is argued that smoke-free legislation has been widely accepted by smokers as a result of their acknowledgment of the governments' responsibility to protect the health of nonsmokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-1" rid="c64">Borland et al., 2006</xref>). As such, understanding people's views of the legitimacy of policy level intervention aimed at changing dietary and physical activity behaviors may help us to understand their ultimate behavioral response, mediated through the development of autonomous versus controlled motivation. Given that findings from policy implementation in other areas shows that attitudes may change following implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Brown, Moodie &amp; Hastings, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1" rid="c47">Tang et al., 2003</xref>), exploring the association between these and motivation could be a useful means of predicting a policy's likely short- and long-term impact.</p>
<p align="left">Little is currently known about public opinion and support for government intervention for obesity and within this for specific obesity policies. One of the few studies available, dating from 2005 and conducted in the United States, suggested that at this time there was little appetite for dramatic policy shifts, with people largely supporting policies that either specifically target children (i.e., posit no direct impact on an adult's own physical activity or dietary habits) or take a relatively benign approach, such as providing information about the health-behavior link and/or the consequences of continuing with a given behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-2" rid="c31">Oliver &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>). Despite being successful in targeting other health behaviors (such as smoking), macroenvironmental policies (e.g., taxes on foods) that generally receive low support from the public are rarely introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Hilbert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-3" rid="c31">Oliver &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>). In 2011, Denmark introduced tax on foods high in saturated fat, however, because of a lack of continued public support and health benefit this strategy was recently revoked (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1" rid="c44">Stones, 2012</xref>). In light of this, the researchers set out to extend our knowledge and understanding in this area to explore: Objective (i), support for a range of obesity policies in the U.K., objective (ii), factors that influence policy support, and objective (iii), how policy support relates to autonomous and controlled motivation toward weight control, in line with the principles of SDT.</p>

<title>Support for obesity policies</title>

The items were taken from a measure by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-4" rid="c2">Barry et al. (2009)</xref>, previously used in America, and asked to rate their level of support for each on a 7-point Likert scale, from 1 (<italic>disagree strongly</italic>) to 7 (<italic>agree strongly</italic>). Adaptations were made to make it applicable to the U.K., thus items referring to laws that are not present in the U.K. were excluded and two items substituted that referred to the U.K.'s national health service, and national insurance payments. The authors of the original scale identified three subscales through factor analysis, representing redistributive, compensatory, and price raising government strategies. Redistributive policies were defined as those that would require a general tax increase for the country (e.g., paid time each day for workers to exercise), compensatory policies defined as those that aimed at helping or protecting citizens (e.g., food warning labels for high fat/sugar content), and price-raising policies as those with putative aims to punish individuals engaging in the behaviors directly associated with obesity (e.g., tax on junk food). An average score for each subscale was calculated. No previous reliability statistics for these subscales were found, but in the present study reliability was as follows: redistributive (7 items, &#945; = .71), compensatory (6 items, &#945; = .52), and price-raising (4 items, &#945; = .77).</p>

The number for the healthiest body was subtracted from the number for the body most like the participants to give a single numerical discrepancy score. A positive score denoted a person perceiving their own body as larger than the healthiest body, a score of zero denoted a person perceiving themselves as the same, and a negative score denoted a person perceiving themselves as having a smaller body.

Six of the statements refer to autonomous motivation (e.g., &#8220;because it is an important choice I really want to make&#8221;) and six to controlled motivation (e.g., &#8220;because I feel pressure from others to be a healthy weight&#8221;), and one score for each subscale was calculated from the average of individual responses. This questionnaire has previously been used in health behavior change research, with the autonomous and controlled subscales being shown to have adequate internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha ranging from.58 to .93; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-1" rid="c59">Williams, Grow, Freedman, Ryan &amp; Deci, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Levesque et al., 2007</xref>).

<title>Procedure</title>
<p align="left">Data collection took place during the summer of 2011 through community settings (e.g., village halls, shopping centers, and leisure centers). Participants were provided with an information sheet detailing the purpose of the research and written consent was obtained. Participants then completed two questionnaires, a minimum of one week apart. At Time 1, demographic variables, beliefs regarding the causes of obesity, perceived severity of obesity, body perception, perceived pressure to be thin, and height and weight were measured. At Time 2, questionnaires assessed motivation toward weight control and support for obesity policies. The study received institutional ethical approval and data were treated confidentially and stored according to the data protection act.</p>

Of the total sample of 188, 42% were male (<italic>n</italic> = 80) and 95% were white (<italic>n</italic> = 179). Participants providing weight measurements were typically older (<italic>t</italic> = &#8722;1.98, <italic>p</italic> = .05), and significantly less likely to believe in environmental (<italic>t</italic> = 2.08 <italic>p</italic> = .04) or genetic causes of obesity (<italic>t</italic> = 2.40, <italic>p</italic> = .02) than those who did not. Fifty percent of these respondents were overweight (<italic>n</italic> = 63), and 74% of the final sample (<italic>n</italic> = 140) were actively trying to control their weight (taking action to lose/gain or maintain weight).

<title>Objective (i): Support for Obesity Policies</title>
<p align="left">A one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare levels of public support for the different policy types. Overall, support for obesity-related policy was high, with an average of 75.5% of participants indicating that they agreed with policy-level intervention (i.e., reported mean scores &gt;4, which represents a neutral response; <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-1" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Support for individual examples of policy ranged from 23% to 87%.

<p align="left"><italic>t</italic> tests were conducted to compare mean levels of support for policy types for overweight and not overweight participants. There was no significant difference in overall levels of policy support according to a person's weight status (i.e., overweight vs. nonoverweight). However, there were significant differences for three individual items (each from different policy groups): &#8220;Tax credits for gym memberships&#8221; had higher support from nonoverweight participants than overweight participants, <italic>t</italic> = 3.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, whereas &#8220;tax on junk food,&#8221; <italic>t</italic> = &#8722;2.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 and &#8220;ban high fat/sugar food advertising on children's TV,&#8221; <italic>t</italic> = &#8722;1.92, <italic>p</italic> = .06 had greater support from overweight than nonoverweight respondents.</p>

<title>Objective (ii): Factors That Influence Policy Support</title>
<p align="left">The relative strength of potential predictors of policy support was assessed through a hierarchical regression analysis, controlling for demographic and personal characteristic variables. The dependent variable, <italic>Support for policy</italic>, was a composite measure computed from combining scores on the three subscales. This was justified as support for the three policy types correlated significantly with general policy support and with each other (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc3-1" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), indicating that rather than discriminating between particular policies, people typically report high/low support for most policy types and for policy in general. Correlations between all the policy variables were strong, except for those between redistributive and compensatory, and redistributive and price raising policies which were still of a moderate and meaningful level.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl3"/></p>
<p align="left">To develop a parsimonious regression model, only variables demonstrating a significant association with policy support in preliminary correlational analyses were included in the analysis. After examination of the correlation matrix, five variables were entered into the regression model. Demographic variables (age and BMI) were entered into the first regression block, and psychosocial variables were entered into the second block (belief in the environmental causes of obesity, perceived pressure to be thin, and the belief that obesity is a major health problem).</p>

<title>Objective (iii): How Policy Support Relates to Motivation Toward Weight Control</title>
<p align="left">The degree to which policy support predicted motivation toward weight loss behaviors was analyzed through linear regression analysis. Psychosocial variables that were theoretically predicted to influence motivation were considered for inclusion in the model, to allow for assessment of whether policy support added meaningful explanatory power to the model. However, to fit a more parsimonious model, only those variables that demonstrated a significant correlation with motivation were entered in the final model (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc3-2" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). This resulted in the inclusion of three additional variables: perceived pressure to be thin, the degree to which obesity is considered a major health problem, and perception of the severity of the risk of obesity. Perceived pressure to be thin has previously been shown to be associated with perceptions of controlled environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Gillison, Standage &amp; Skevington, 2006</xref>). The perceived severity of obesity, and its importance as a major health problem were included as they relate to the degree to which a person has internalized (i.e., accepted) the reasons why policies endorse behavior change (i.e., acknowledged a rationale for change; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">Deci, Eghrari, Patrick &amp; Leone, 1994</xref>). The effects of policy support on autonomous and controlled motivation were considered in separate analyses, as there would be different implications to findings of effects on each type of motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">Standage &amp; Ryan, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">The regression model was not significantly predictive of autonomous motivation (<italic>R</italic><sup location="post">2</sup> = 0.03) but was significantly predictive of controlled motivation (<italic>R</italic><sup location="post">2</sup> = 0.14; see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc5-1" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Controlled motivation was significantly negatively predicted by redistributive policy support (&#946; = &#8722;.18) and significantly positively predicted by compensatory policy support (&#946; = .32), price-raising policy support (&#946; = .12), and perceived pressure to be thin (&#946; = .21). The inclusion of the additional psychosocial variables resulted in an increase in the proportion of variance explained by the model from 1.4% to 3% for autonomous motivation (<italic>R</italic><sup location="post">2</sup> = 0.01 vs. <italic>R</italic><sup location="post">2</sup> = 0.03) and from 11.7% to 13.7% for controlled motivation (<italic>R</italic><sup location="post">2</sup> = 0.12 vs. <italic>R</italic><sup location="post">2</sup> = 0.14).<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl5"/></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p align="left">The present study sought to explore current levels of support for obesity policies in the U.K., the factors that influence it, and how it relates to people's motivation to control their weight.</p>
<sec id="s21" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Support for Obesity Policies</title>
<p align="left">The results showed considerable variation in support for individual obesity policies across the 17 proposed policies. When grouped into three types of policies according to theoretical principles, redistributive, compensatory, and price-raising (as in previous papers, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-5" rid="c2">Barry et al., 2009</xref>), support was higher for compensatory and redistributive policies and lower for price raising policies. This difference is consistent with previous research in obesity and smoking domains where it was shown that support for policies requiring price-raising elements had significantly less general public support than those that involve child protection, personal assistance, compensatory, or redistributive based strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-6" rid="c2">Barry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">ASH, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">A possible explanation for this trend is the amount of personal impact that each will have on a person's financial situation or lifestyle, or the amount of effort that would be required to engage with it. For example, many of the redistributive policies that have a high level of support involve educational interventions, mostly addressing children. As such there are no financial, behavioral, or other direct consequences on adults themselves, so there would be few implications of supporting them. Similarly, both compensatory and redistributive policies target the environment in ways that require minimal active engagement; redistributive polices focus on providing healthy opportunities that people are not obliged to take up (e.g., network of treatment programs, or paid time available for exercise within the workplace) and compensatory policies impose restriction of unhealthy environments that would similarly not impinge on a person's habits or time (e.g., banning advertising, requiring restaurants to prepare healthier foods). Conversely, price-raising policies have a more direct and punitive impact on the individual, for example, requiring them to pay more tax. Within the present sample, support for redistributive and compensatory policies was positively associated with beliefs in the national importance of obesity, but this association was not found for price-raising policies (i.e., those with more perceptible financial impacts). That is, the visibility of anticipated sacrifice appeared to moderate the relationship between the perception of the issue's importance and policy support.</p>

<sec id="s22" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Factors That Influence Policy Support</title>
<p align="left">Previous international research has highlighted numerous factors that influence policy support, such as beliefs in the causes of obesity, its perceived importance, assessments of personal costs and benefits, and a person's level of support for policy intervention in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-7" rid="c2">Barry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-2" rid="c8">Carlson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-5" rid="c31">Oliver &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>). One of the aims of the present study was therefore to assess whether these factors also proved important in our U.K. sample, and to clarify which of these may be the most influential in predicting policy support. In addition, we included variables that research in other health domains reports to influence levels of support, but are absent from existing work in the obesity policy domain. One such factor, extrapolated from findings that heavier smokers are less likely to support tobacco control policies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-2" rid="c18">Gardner &amp; West, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-2" rid="c37">Rosenberg et al., 2012</xref>), was the prediction that there would be lesser support for obesity-related policies from overweight than from nonoverweight people. However, although there were differences of small effect size in three isolated policies (notably with different directions of effect), there was no overall difference in the level of support for any of the three different types of policy support according to weight status in our sample.</p>
<p align="left">One reason for this lack of effect may be the difference between behaviors that policy tries to influence. Smoking is a discrete behavior that nonsmokers do not engage in, so any restrictions and penalties for smoking will have little or no direct negative effect on them. However, the targets of obesity policy, diet and exercise, are factors that affect all people; indeed there are many healthy weight people who are sedentary and/or who eat a poor diet and may be equally affected by policy change. An alternative or further explanation may lie in levels of awareness; many people who are overweight do not recognize themselves as such (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Kuchler &amp; Variyam, 2003</xref>), or believe they are overweight due to reasons beyond their control (i.e., medical or genetic factors; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-1" rid="c52">Wang &amp; Coups, 2010</xref>). As such, they may not perceive policies to be directed toward them in the way that smokers would. Further work would be valuable to explore whether factors such as lack of awareness may be in some respects advantageous (e.g., by reducing defensiveness) or problematic as people may not perceived displayed messages as relevant to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">Wammes, Breedveld, Looman &amp; Brug, 2007</xref>). Understanding the factors behind the lack of difference in responses between overweight and nonoverweight people thus may be important to tailoring the content and delivery of health promoting policies.</p>
<p align="left">Greater support for obesity policies across participants of all weight categories was associated with greater perceived pressure from friends, family, and the media to be thin. This finding supports previous theoretical research suggesting that attitudes are shaped by knowledge and personal interest in the subject; that is, people who were aware that obesity is a health threat and feel pressure from society to lose weight were more likely to support policies that may help them to achieve this (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-6" rid="c31">Oliver &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>). The finding of a significant relationship between perceived pressure and policy support has not been previously reported and may provide a new insight to direct future research. For example, people who feel that it is society that is pushing them to act in certain ways may feel that the same society therefore <italic>ought</italic> to help them to achieve these aims, and thereby consider changes to the environment to support this as justified. Further qualitative work would be informative to explore whether this, or alternative explanations underpin this relationship.</p>

<title>How Policy Support Relates to Motivation Toward Weight Control</title>
<p align="left">Support for obesity policies significantly predicted controlled motivation, but not autonomous motivation. The lack of association with autonomous motivation was initially unexpected given that according to the tenets of SDT, the acceptance of the rationale for change is associated with more autonomous functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000b</xref>), and the understanding of such a rationale (i.e., belief that obesity is an important public health issue) was found to positively predict policy support in the present study. However, the association between policy support and controlled motivation may be indicative that even when people support policy as a result of recognizing the importance of national initiatives to prevent obesity, and/or the difficulty of losing weight on one's own, they still experience it as controlling when applying it to their own behavior. The findings for controlled motivation are difficult to interpret as controlled motivation was positively predicted by support for two policy types (compensatory and price-raising) but negatively predicted by redistributive policy support. A key difference between redistributive policies and other variants is the degree to which people have a choice whether or not to engage with them; people can opt out of redistributive policies (e.g., tax credits for gym membership, paid time for daily exercise at work) whereas the remaining types are imposed on them (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-7" rid="c31">Oliver &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>). This interpretation is consistent with the directions of effect on controlled motivation. It is interesting that people may support a policy and yet still feel controlled by it, as is indicated for compensatory and price-raising policy types. On a psychological level this may reflect people's lack of belief in their ability to control their weight through their own individual actions, so supporting policies that change the social or financial environment may reflect help-seeking behavior in the form of requesting additional external controls to be imposed. Past work in the SDT domain documents how people often initially ask for constraints to be imposed on them to help them to change their behavior, but that the provision of these external controls does not lead to successfully sustained behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-2" rid="c43">Standage &amp; Ryan, 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s24" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p align="left">Although the present study provides some novel findings and suggests new directions for conceptualizing obesity-related policy research, there are a number of limitations to our conclusions. First, the study was cross-sectional, and so causal relationships between the policy environment and motivation cannot be inferred. Second, the policy examples provided to participants related to changing either dietary or physical activity environments, but we measured motivation toward weight control. This was to simplify the study, because it was considered from pilot work that participants would be less likely to complete the survey instruments if all measures were repeated for diet and exercise separately. However, we may not have captured the relationship between policy support and motivation for health behaviors that was independent of a weight loss or maintenance goal. A further limitation is the limited reliability of some of the scales that were used. The causal beliefs about obesity subscales had particularly low scale reliability, potentially because of the amendments that were made to the original <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-8" rid="c31">Oliver and Lee (2005)</xref> scale to effectively account for environmental causes. The results which involve these must therefore be treated with caution. Finally, our sample was not sufficiently large to allow us to conduct more advanced statistical analyses (i.e., structural equation modeling) incorporating all variables in a single model.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications for Policy Makers</title>
<p align="left">The present study provides a contemporary snapshot of the level of support for obesity-related policy in the U.K., and novel insights into associations between support for policy, beliefs around obesity, and an individual's motivation for taking steps to control their own weight. It is one of the first studies to look at individual responses to the social environment on the policy level and is the first study to look at the policy environment in the obesity context in the U.K. Furthermore, through including the objective assessment of BMI, we extended past work to enable us to explore the impact of a person's own weight on their views relating to the introduction of obesity-related policies.</p>
<p align="left">Although support for policies is known to change after their implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-2" rid="c15">Fong et al., 2006</xref>), initial public support is still important in predicting the success of policies as a result of their acceptance, and also to the commitment of policymakers to their implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-9" rid="c31">Oliver &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-1" rid="c55">Wellever, Reichard &amp; Velasco, 2004</xref>). Understanding the determinants of policy support is therefore important for identifying factors that underpin public attitudes toward policies, providing information to policymakers regarding factors they could target to enhance the chance of engagement and acceptance of planned policy changes. One key finding of the current study in this respect was that the public already appreciate that obesity is a significant health issue and that it poses a significant national public health challenge, so further educational initiatives to this effect may have limited additional impact. However, despite relatively widespread support for obesity-related policy, this support is associated with controlled motivation suggesting that people have yet to fully accept the personal benefits of maintaining a healthy weight, and still feel they are at least partially acting for extrinsic motives (i.e., to please/adhere to the priorities of others).</p>
<p align="left">Theory suggests that behavior changes prompted by controlled motivation would be short-lived. As such, future initiatives may need to focus on communicating more personally relevant reasons for engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors, helping people to feel they are acting less out of duty to others (e.g., from the perceived societal pressures to be thin, and reduce obesity related costs to the NHS), and more for their own benefit (e.g., to feel better, or prolong their own lives). Further qualitative work to explore what messages may resonate best with different groups of the population would be valuable.</p>
