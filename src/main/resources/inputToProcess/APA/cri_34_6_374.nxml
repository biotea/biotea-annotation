<p align="left"><italic>Background:</italic> Suicide in schizophrenia is a serious problem
                    &#8211; ideation rates go up to 40%, and approximately one half of
                    patients attempt suicide at least once. The distinction between attempters and
                    ideators is vital in everyday clinical practice. <italic>Aim:</italic> To
                    explore the association between psychopathology and suicidal behavior in a
                    comparative study of three groups of patients with schizophrenia: suicide
                    ideators, suicide attempters, and subjects without suicide ideation and
                    behavior. <italic>Method:</italic> The study included 509 patients: suicide
                    attempters (<italic>n</italic> = 159), ideators (<italic>n</italic> = 180), and
                    a comparative group (<italic>n</italic> = 170). The clinical assessment
                    consisted of a structured psychiatric interview and an evaluation of
                    sociodemographics, suicidality (SIBQ), psychopathology (PANSS), and depression
                    (CDSS). <italic>Results:</italic> Suicide attempters were more depressed than
                    ideators, and both groups had higher CDSS scores than the comparative group. The
                    overall contribution of positive, negative, and general PANSS symptoms was not
                    statistically significant enough to differentiate ideators from attempters. A
                    principal component analysis of the PANSS items revealed five components:
                        <italic>disinhibition, withdrawal, anxiety and guilt, reality
                        distortion,</italic> and <italic>disorganization</italic>. Two logistic
                    regression analyses showed that suicide ideation or attempt was significantly
                    related to depression, anxiety, guilt, gender, age, and number of previous
                    hospitalizations. Compared to suicide ideators, attempters were more depressed,
                    had a higher number of previous hospitalizations, and lower education.
                        <italic>Conclusion:</italic> The results indicate that clinicians should
                    look for depression, anxiety, and guilt feelings, while positive and negative
                    symptoms seem to be less relevant for suicide assessment in schizophrenia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
            
<p align="left">The lifetime risk of suicide in schizophrenia is approximately 5%
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Palmer, Pankratz, &amp; Bostwick,
                    2005</xref>). Suicide ideation seems to affect approximately
                20&#8211;40% of individuals with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Fialko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Kontaxakis et al., 2004</xref>), and around 50% of
                patients will eventually attempt suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Montross et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">Tarrier, Barrowclough, Andrews, &amp; Gregg,
                2004</xref>). The probability of suicide attempt is even higher in
                depression and alcohol-related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">De
                    Hert &amp; Peuskens, 2000</xref>), and suicide attempts in
                schizophrenia seem to be more serious and fatal than in other psychiatric disorders
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Hunt et al., 2006</xref>;
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Warman, Forman, Henriques, Brown, &amp;
                    Beck, 2004</xref>).</p>
            
<p align="left">Suicide risk factors in schizophrenia can be divided into two groups
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-2" rid="c6">De Hert &amp; Peuskens,
                    2000</xref>). The first includes general risk factors, such as
                being white, male, single, unemployed, socially isolated, having a personal or
                family history of suicide behavior, or having experienced a recent loss, a physical
                illness, depression, or feelings of hopelessness. The second group is characterized
                by specific aspects of schizophrenia such as good premorbid level of functioning,
                high IQ, high level of education, early stage of illness (age 20&#8211;35 years),
                recent hospital discharge, and low tolerance to stressful life events
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-3" rid="c6">De Hert &amp; Peuskens,
                    2000</xref>). Results from prospective studies provide even better
                insight into this issue. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">Jarbin and Von Knorring (2004)</xref> followed up 88 patients who
                had psychosis in adolescence for a decade and found that about 4% committed
                and 25% attempted suicide; attempts were associated with more depressive and
                fewer negative symptoms in the first psychotic episode, and with more
                hospitalizations and addiction to nicotine during the years of monitoring. Depressed
                mood and insight into one&#8217;s own illness can lead to feelings of helplessness,
                a particularly dangerous risk factor for suicide. Harkavy-Friedman and colleagues
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Harkavy-Friedman, Nelson, Venarde,
                    &amp; Mann, 2004</xref>) studied suicide and depression in 86
                patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and reported that one third
                of these patients attempted suicide about 4.5 years after the psychosis onset and
                about seven and a half years after the first depressive episode. Even though
                depression was present in both attempters and nonattempters, it is worth noting that
                almost half of depressed patients never attempted suicide, despite long-term
                depression. The Finnish national suicide prevention study (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">Heila et al., 1997</xref>) showed that during
                the first year after suicide attempt, the active form of the disease was present in
                78% of participants, depressive symptoms in 64%, previous suicidal
                attempts in 71%, and command hallucinations in 10% of participants.
                The existence of this type of hallucination was not clearly demonstrated as a risk
                factor, but it can be especially dangerous to those who have already attempted
                suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Harkavy-Friedman et al.,
                    2003</xref>).</p>
            
<p align="left">The aim of our study was to further explore the association between psychopathology
                and suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia. To our knowledge, this is the
                first investigation to address this issue in a comparative study of three groups of
                patients with schizophrenia: suicide ideators, suicide attempters, and participants
                without suicide ideation and behavior.</p>

                    and Neuropsychiatric Hospital &#8221;Ivan Barbot,&#8221; Popova&#269;a. Each

                    approval to conduct the study was obtained from the ethics boards of the
                    abovementioned institutions. The participants were included after being admitted
                    to hospital because of suicide attempt (group 1, <italic>n</italic> = 159;
                    31.2%), worsening of mental condition with the emergence of suicidal
                    thoughts and high risk of committing suicide (group 2, <italic>n</italic> = 180;
                    35.4%), and worsening of mental condition that was not accompanied by
                    suicide ideation or attempts at the time of admission or ever before (group 3,

<p align="left">The clinical assessments included structured psychiatric interviews, collection
                    of sociodemographic characteristics, and evaluation (1) of suicidality using the
                    Suicide Ideation and Behaviour Questionnaire (SIBQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Maru&#353;i&#269;, Ro&#353;kar, &amp; Zorko,
                        2007</xref>), (2) of psychopathology using the Positive and
                    Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Kay,
                        Fiszbein, &amp; Opler, 1987</xref>), and (3) of depression
                    using the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Addington, Addington, &amp; Schissel,
                        1990</xref>). </p>
                
<p align="left">The SIBQ consists of 14 questions, divided into two sections. The first includes
                    ten questions in a &#8221;yes/no&#8221; format assessing nine levels of
                    suicidality. It is created to measure suicidality &#8211; as a dimension that
                    arises from passive to active suicide thoughts &#8211; and suicide behavior and
                    attempt. The tenth question is intended for suicide attempters and assesses
                    desire for attempting suicide with a 5-point Likert scale (from <italic>I never
                        wanted to die</italic> to <italic>I was determined to die</italic>). The
                    second part consists of four questions related to the family history of
                    attempted and completed suicides. Since patients tend to suppress and distort
                    the information on suicide behavior, special attention was given to the
                    assessment of suicide ideation and attempt. Data gathered from the clinical
                    interview and the SIBQ were double-checked with the medical charts and family
                    members, and only participants with consistent data were included in the sample.
                    In 11 cases, the SIBQ results indicated that participants attempted suicide, but
                    the interview revealed that they took a large amount of anxiolytics to calm down
                    and fall asleep not to kill themselves (<italic>n</italic> = 6), or it was not
                    possible to confirm suicide attempt (<italic>n</italic> = 5). These participants
                    were excluded from the analysis in our study. </p>
                
<p align="left">The PANSS is composed of 30 items organized in three subscales: positive symptoms
                    (items P1&#8211;P7), negative symptoms (items N1&#8211;N7), and general
                    psychopathology (items G1&#8211;G16). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity
                    scale (the higher the number, the more severe the symptom).</p>
                
<p align="left">The CDSS is a scale developed specifically for assessment of the level of
                    depression in schizophrenia. It is composed of nine items and each item has a
                    4-point measure, each point anchored by descriptors (0 =
                    <italic>absent</italic>, 3 = <italic>severe</italic>). The sum of all items was
                    calculated and included in the analysis.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                
<p align="left">Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS software (Version 20). Descriptive statistics
                    were calculated separately for each group of participants (participants with
                    suicide attempt, participants with suicide ideation, and participants without
                    suicide ideation or attempt) and for the total sample. Next, two binary logistic
                    regression analyses were used to estimate which of the examined variables are
                    independently associated with suicidal behavior. In the first logistic
                    regression analysis, participants with suicide ideation or attempt (both groups
                    were merged) were compared with the control group. With this analysis, we wanted
                    to examine which factors are related to the presence of any type of suicidal
                    behavior. The second logistic regression analysis aimed at uncovering the
                    factors that differentiate participants with suicide attempt from participants
                    with suicide ideation. </p>
                
<p align="left">Prior to logistic regressions, we needed to reduce a large number of predictor
                    variables. Because the PANSS scale with 30 items does not have a stable
                    factorial validity across studies (Van
                        der Gaag et al. 2007), a principal component analysis
                    with a direct oblimin rotation was conducted on the total sample data and five
                    components were extracted according to the results of parallel analysis
                        (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Watkins 2008</xref>).
                    If a certain item loaded on more than one component, it was excluded. Only items
                    with component loadings higher than .40 were retained. The remaining items
                    within each component were then averaged (items on Component 4 were scored
                    reverse).</p>
                
<p align="left">In logistic regression analyses, the categorical predictors were gender (with
                    females as a reference category), marital status (married vs. not married as a
                    reference category), employment (employed or in education vs. not employed or
                    retired as a reference category), and compliance (regular taking of
                    antipsychotics prior to the last hospitalization vs. noncompliance as a
                    reference category); among the interval variables there were: education in
                    years, age at schizophrenia onset, number of previous hospitalizations, CDSS
                    score, and the values of five PANSS components. All predictors were
                    simultaneously entered in each model.</p>

<title>Results</title>
            
<p align="left">A detailed description of the study participants is given in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-1" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-1" rid="tbl2">2</xref>. The majority of
                participants were women (<italic>n</italic> = 270, 53%), with high school
                education (<italic>n</italic> = 318, 62%) and single (<italic>n</italic> =
                309, 61%). Their mean age was 33.7 years. A higher percentage of suicide
                attempters were unemployed or retired and a lower percentage complied with the
                treatment in terms of regularly using antipsychotics prior to the current
                hospitalization (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-2" rid="tbl1">Table
                1</xref>). There was a higher percentage of men in the groups with suicide
                ideation or attempt than in the group without suicide ideation or attempt. As shown
                in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-2" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, suicide ideators
                were on average somewhat younger than those without suicide ideation. Suicide
                attempters had greater mean number of institutional admissions than the other two
                groups. They were also more depressed than suicide ideators, but both these groups
                had higher CDSS scores than participants without suicidal behavior. Differences
                between the three groups could also be identified on several PANSS items.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl1 tbl2"/></p>
            
<p align="left">The principal components analysis of PANSS items gave a 5-component solution. The
                pattern matrix is shown in the five rightmost columns of <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-3" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. The first component included hyperactivity,
                hostility, uncooperativeness, lack of judgment and control, and poor impulse
                control, and could be named <italic>disinhibition</italic>. The second component
                comprised emotional and social withdrawal, poor rapport, lack of spontaneity and
                flow, and motor retardation, and we named it <italic>withdrawal</italic>. The third
                component consisted of anxiety, tension, and guilt feelings, and was therefore named
                    <italic>anxiety and guilt</italic>. The fourth component represented the
                presence of delusions, hallucinations, unusual thought content and preoccupation,
                and was named <italic>reality distortion</italic>. The fifth component included
                conceptual disorganization, difficulty in abstract thinking, stereotyped thinking,
                mannerism and posturing, disorientation and poor attention, and was called
                    <italic>disorganization</italic>. Depression (item G6) was not included in any
                component because of its multiple loading. Depression, as measured by CDSS, was
                entered as a separate predictor in the logistic regression analyses.</p>
            
<p align="left">Both the first and the second logistic regression resulted in the model that
                outperformed the intercept-only model: for the first regression model,
                    &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(13) = 121.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and for the
                second, &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(13) = 34.98, <italic>p</italic> = .001. The models fitted
                the data well: for the first model, Hosmer and Lemeshow &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(8) = 3.76,
                    <italic>p</italic> = .878, and for the second model, Hosmer and Lemeshow
                    &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(8) = 6.89, <italic>p</italic> = .549. The first model yielded
                a 74.9% correct classification of participants into two groups as compared to
                the intercept-only model with 66.6% of participants in the modal category
                (suicide ideation or attempt), and explained a moderate amount of variance
                (Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup location="post">2</sup> = .294). The second model yielded a
                63.1% correct classification of participants into two groups as compared to
                the intercept-only model with 53.1% of participants in the modal category
                (attempt group), and explained a small amount of variance (Nagelkerke
                    <italic>R</italic><sup location="post">2</sup> = .131).</p>
            
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="table" id="tbc3-1" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> summarizes the effects of the predictors included in the two
                logistic regression models. In statistical terms, in the first model where the
                participants with either suicide ideation or attempt were compared with the control
                group, predictors with significant negative coefficients decrease the likelihood of
                the participant belonging to the group showing suicidal behavior with respect to the
                control group, and predictors with positive coefficients increase this likelihood.
                The prevalence of suicide behavior (either ideation or attempt) was significantly
                higher in male than in female patients. The odds of suicidal behavior decreased with
                age (i.e., the odds of suicidal behavior decreased by 3.4% each year) and it
                increased with number of prior hospitalizations (i.e., with each hospitalization the
                odds that suicidal behavior was indicated increased by 10.7%), depression (a
                1-point increase on the CDSS scale corresponded to a 1.14 times higher odds of
                suicidal behavior), and anxiety and guilt. In the second model where the group with
                suicide attempt was compared with the suicide ideation group, the odds ratio (the
                odds that the participant is in the attempt group as compared to the odds that
                he/she is in the ideation group) was positively related to number of previous
                hospitalizations and depression, and negatively related to education. <xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl3"/></p>
            
<p align="left">In 159 analyzed participants who attempted suicide, the most frequent method was drug
                overdose (<italic>n</italic> = 78, 49%), followed by deep cutting wounds
                    (<italic>n</italic> = 25, 16%), hanging (<italic>n</italic> = 12,
                8%), and jumping from heights (<italic>n</italic> = 11, 7%). Most of
                these attempts happened during an ongoing psychiatric treatment (<italic>n</italic>
                = 97, 61%) and could be classified as violent (<italic>n</italic> = 78,
                49%). </p>
            
<p align="left">Family histories revealed that out of 509 participants, 67 (13.2%) had a
                family member who died by suicide, mostly aunts or uncles (<italic>n</italic> = 29),
                followed by grandparents (<italic>n</italic> = 15), siblings (<italic>n</italic> =
                8), father (<italic>n</italic> = 8), and mother (<italic>n</italic> = 7). Such cases
                were reported by 24 (15%) suicide attempters, 26 (14%) suicide
                ideators, and 17 (10%) patients without suicide attempt or ideation. The
                incidence of suicide in family members did not differ among the three groups,
                    &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(2) = 2.27, <italic>p</italic> = .322. In addition, 26
                participants (5%) in the total sample reported that a family member attempted
                suicide but did not complete it, mostly a mother (<italic>n</italic> = 6), followed
                by an aunt or uncle (<italic>n</italic> = 5), grandparent (<italic>n</italic> = 5),

                child (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Although the presence of suicide attempt was most

<title>Discussion</title>
            
<p align="left">The aim of our study was to explore the association between psychopathology and
                suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia in order to improve our
                understanding of the differences between suicide ideators and attempters. Firstly,
                our attempt was to analyze the role of positive, negative, and general
                psychopathology (according to the PANSS scale). Out of these symptom subgroups, only
                negative symptoms were found to discriminate among the patients: In comparison to
                the group of patients without suicide attempt or ideation (the reference group),
                some of the negative symptoms were slightly higher in the groups with suicide
                ideation or attempt (e.g., emotional withdrawal and passive/apathetic social
                withdrawal), whereas some others were slightly lower (e.g., blunted affect, poor
                rapport, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, stereotyped thinking).
                However, the overall contribution of negative symptoms was not statistically
                significant enough to help differentiate ideators from attempters.</p>
            
<p align="left">The notion that not all symptoms forming a certain PANSS subscale may be related to
                suicidal behavior in a similar manner led us to perform a principal component
                analysis of the PANSS items in order to extract the groups of related symptoms. Five
                components were extracted: (1) disinhibition, (2) withdrawal, (3) anxiety and guilt,
                (4) reality distortion, and (5) disorganization. Out of these components, only
                anxiety and guilt were found to be relevant for further discussion. In the first
                logistic regression model where the participants with either suicide ideation or
                attempt were compared with the control group, the ratio of odds that participants
                belonged to the groups with suicidal behavior and the odds that they belonged to a
                reference group increased with higher anxiety and guilt. Not unexpectedly,
                depression also had a very strong association with suicidal behavior: In both
                logistic regression models (suicide ideators + suicide attempters vs. control
                group and suicide ideators vs. suicide attempters), depression increased the odds of
                the outcome variable. In other words, suicide attempters and ideators scored higher
                on the depression scale compared to the control group, and the attempters were more
                depressed than the ideators. Data from previous studies repeatedly show that
                depression is strongly linked to suicide, while the extent to which anxiety symptoms
                and/or disorders contribute to suicide ideation and attempt is less clear.
                Despite some evidence of the independent contribution of anxiety disorders to
                suicide ideation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Norton, Temple, &amp;
                    Pettit, 2008</xref>), depression seems to convey a much stronger
                risk that goes beyond any co-occurring anxiety symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Eikelenboom, Smit, Beekman, &amp; Penninx,
                    2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Spijker, de
                    Graaf, Ten Have, Nolen, &amp; Speckens, 2010</xref>;

                    &amp; Keller 2012</xref>). Our results point in the same direction
                and add to this discussion. Although the anxiety symptoms were not specific enough
                to discriminate between suicide ideators and attempters, they discriminated well
                between the groups with suicidal behavior and the reference group, while depressive
                symptoms had the power to discriminate among all three groups. </p>
            
<p align="left">Our results are in accordance with those of other studies showing that suicide
                behavior in schizophrenia is not directly related to psychotic symptoms such as
                delusions and hallucinations, but to depressive mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Cotton, Drake, &amp; Gates, 1985</xref>;

                patients, as part of a psychological prevention of relapse in psychosis program, and
                noted that affective commitment in relation to hallucinations and delusions could be
                a key factor associated with suicidal thinking in patients with relapsed disease,
                and that the genesis of suicidal thoughts was in the changed mood rather than in
                psychoticism. Suicidal ideation is very common among patients with schizophrenia and
                has been long recognized as a risk factor for suicide attempt. Nordentoft and her colleagues (2005)
                followed up patients with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorders for 1 year
                and found that suicidal ideation and plans in the prior year were predicted by
                hopelessness scores, while actual suicide attempts in the prior year were predicted
                by both depression and hopelessness scores. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Hocaoglu and Babuc (2009)</xref> reported that depression was seen
                in approximately 47% of a group having suicidal ideation, while there was no
                depression in a group not having suicidal ideation. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-2" rid="c18">Kontaxakis and colleagues (2004)</xref>
                pointed out that the prevention of suicidal behaviors in schizophrenia patients
                should probably focus on reducing depressive and guilt feelings and on helping the
                individual to enhance self-esteem. </p>
            
<p align="left">Our results also indicate the relevance of several other suicide risk factors, such
                as younger age, male gender, lower education, positive family history, and more
                previous hospitalizations. The literature reports that the high-risk patients are
                young men with good premorbid functioning, higher IQ, and higher education
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">Hawton, Sutton, Haw, Sinclair, &amp;
                    Deeks, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Lester, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Pompili et al., 2007</xref>). Our results support previous
                findings regarding age and gender, as we found that the odds of suicidal behavior
                decreased with age and that the prevalence of suicide behavior (either ideation or
                attempt) was significantly higher in male than in female patients. However, in our
                study a higher level of education seemed to decrease the odds for suicide attempt.
                One way to explain this might be the fact that our participants were not at the
                beginning of their illness when the risk is highest for those with higher IQ and
                higher education, who can be more aware of the negative impact of illness on their
                future life plans. On the contrary, with time they could have developed a less
                restrictive point of view and their higher education could have been helpful.</p>
            
<p align="left">A large number of our participants (altogether 18%) reported a family history
                positive for suicide behavior. Although the differences between the three groups did
                not reach the level of statistical significance, it is important to note that the
                presence of positive family histories was the highest in the group of suicide
                attempters, followed by the group of suicide ideators and patients without suicide
                behavior. A family history of suicide was previously associated with a higher risk
                for suicide attempt, with high-lethality methods, with repeated attempts, and with
                number of attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Tremeau et al.,
                    2005</xref>). Interestingly, it has been reported that relatives of
                suicide completers have higher levels of ideation compared to relatives of
                nonsuicidal subjects, suggesting that it is the severity rather than the presence of
                suicidal ideation that may be the part of the tendency toward suicide transmitted in
                families (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Kim et al.,
                    2005</xref>). </p>
            
<p align="left">The majority of suicide attempts in our study happened during an ongoing psychiatric
                treatment and the odds of suicide attempts increased with the number of prior
                hospitalizations. This might indicate that these participants suffered from a
                greater burden of symptoms, but it might also be argued that if these patients tend
                toward suicide behavior, this tendency itself would increase the likelihood of
                hospitalization independent of illness severity. One way to improve our
                understanding of the association between the number of hospitalizations and suicidal
                behavior would be to analyze in more detail the reasons for each hospital admission.
                The suicide attempts in this study included mainly severe drug overdose, deep
                cutting wounds, hanging, and jumping from heights. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Breier and Astrachan (1984)</xref> reported that
                individuals with schizophrenia tend to use more lethal and violent suicide methods
                than individuals without schizophrenia. For example, jumping from a height was the
                most frequently used method among people with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Kreyenbuhl, Kelly, &amp; Conley,
                2002</xref>). Interestingly, Baca Garcia and colleagues
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Baca-Garcia, Perez-Rodriguez, Diaz
                    Sastre, Saiz-Ruiz, &amp; de Leon, 2005</xref>) compared the
                frequencies and suicide attempt characteristics in patients with schizophrenia and
                major depression, and found no significant differences in attempt methods. However,
                attempts in schizophrenia were more lethal, and although not associated with higher
                impulsivity scores, there was a trend toward higher scores in aggressive behavior
                history. In another study, by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-2" rid="c12">Heila and
                    colleagues (1997)</xref>, the methods were far less violent owing
                to a high proportion of drug overdoses, as in our study. A possible explanation of
                this finding is that these patients were in psychiatric treatment and therefore had
                relatively easy access to drugs.</p>
            
<p align="left">The major limitation of our study is its cross-sectional design, which is why our
                findings refer only to the association of suicide behavior with other studied
                variables, not to the prognostic value of psychopathology and other variables for
                suicide behavior. The strength of our study lies in the large sample size and
                specific subgroups (the attempters, the ideators, and the comparative subgroup of
                patients with schizophrenia).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
            
<p align="left">In conclusion, our results indicate that risk assessment in schizophrenia should
                focus on depression, anxiety, and guilt feelings, while positive and negative
                symptoms do not seem to uniquely contribute to the association between
                psychopathology and suicide behavior. Although anxiety symptoms may not be specific
                enough to discriminate between suicide ideators and attempters, depressive symptoms
                could have the crucial power to detect those who are at the highest suicide risk.
