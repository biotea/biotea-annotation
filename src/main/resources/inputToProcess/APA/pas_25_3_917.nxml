<p align="left">The Secondary Trauma Self-Efficacy (STSE) Scale was developed and psychometrically evaluated in 2 studies targeting populations indirectly exposed to traumatic events through work with traumatized clients. Study 1 enrolled behavioral health professionals (<italic>n</italic> = 247) providing trauma therapy for military clients in the United States. Study 2 investigated characteristics of the STSE Scale among health care and social workers (<italic>n</italic><sub location="post">T1</sub> = 306, <italic>n</italic><sub location="post">T2</sub> = 193) providing services for trauma victims and survivors in Poland. Rooted in social cognitive theory, the 7-item STSE Scale is used to evaluate perceived ability to cope with the challenging demands resulting from work with traumatized clients and perceived ability to deal with the secondary traumatic stress symptoms. In both studies, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis showed unidimensionality of the scale. The results indicated good internal consistency of the STSE Scale and its stability over time. STSE correlated highly or moderately with secondary traumatic stress symptoms. Comparatively, associations between STSE and perceived social support, secondary traumatic growth, and negative beliefs about the world and self were either moderate or low. The STSE factor structure and pattern of correlations with the validity measures were invariant across the 2 studies, which indicated that the STSE Scale may be a culturally unbiased instrument.</p>

<p align="left"><italic>Secondary exposure to trauma</italic> refers to the widespread phenomenon of indirect exposure to different types of traumatic material, such as contacts with people who have experienced traumatic events, exposure to graphic trauma content (e.g., reported by the survivor), exposure to people&#8216;s cruelty to one another, and observation of and participation in traumatic reenactments (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Pearlman &amp; Saakvitne, 1995</xref>). Indirect exposure may be an inherent characteristic of occupations such as mental health, health care, and social work, which involve providing clinical services to traumatized populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Elwood, Mott, Lohr, &amp; Galovski, 2011</xref>). Although indirect (also referred to as <italic>secondary</italic> or <italic>vicarious</italic>) exposure to trauma through work might have a positive effect on service providers&#8217; posttraumatic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Brockhouse, Msetfi, Cohen, &amp; Joseph, 2011</xref>), research suggests that indirect exposure is related to higher levels of distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Pearlman &amp; MacIan, 1995</xref>), negative cognitions or low levels of self-trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-2" rid="c30">Pearlman &amp; MacIan, 1995</xref>), and secondary traumatic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-2" rid="c20">Elwood et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Secondary traumatic stress is one of the most often investigated negative consequences of indirect exposure to trauma. Although there are many definitions of <italic>secondary traumatic stress</italic>, in this article it is defined as reactions resembling posttraumatic stress, such as intrusive re-experiencing of the traumatic material, avoidance of trauma triggers, and emotions and increased arousal, all resulting from indirect exposure to trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Bride, Robinson, Yegidis, &amp; Figley, 2004</xref>). Prevalence of secondary traumatic stress varies from 15.2% among social workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Bride, 2007</xref>), 16.3% in oncology staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Quinal, Harford, &amp; Rutledge, 2009</xref>), 19% in substance abuse counselors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Bride, Hatcher, &amp; Humble, 2009</xref>), 32.8% in emergency nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Dominguez-Gomez &amp; Rutledge, 2009</xref>), 34% in child protective services workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Bride, Jones, &amp; MacMaster, 2007</xref>), to 39% in juvenile justice education workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Hatcher, Bride, Oh, King, &amp; Catrett, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Self-Efficacy as a Protective Factor</title>
<p align="left">In response to the common secondary traumatization exposure and its consequences among several occupational groups, researchers and professionals have advocated for testing protective factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-3" rid="c20">Elwood et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">Tyson, 2007</xref>). Some individual protective characteristics, such as years of experience as a clinician (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Voss Horrell, Holohan, Didion, &amp; Vance, 2011</xref>), may be hard to modify. The effectiveness of self-care activities (e.g., leisure time) in reduction or prevention of distress and secondary traumatic stress symptoms is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Bober &amp; Regehr, 2006</xref>). In contrast, trauma-related cognitions, such as self-efficacy, are modifiable factors that may contribute to posttraumatic adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Self-efficacy is among the cognitions that may be seen as a proximal determinant of health-related outcomes after a traumatic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Benight &amp; Bandura, 2004</xref>). According to social cognitive theory (SCT), self-efficacy mirrors a sense of control over environment and refers to the perceived ability to master challenging demands (such as major stressful events and their aftermath) by means of adaptive actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">Bandura, 1997</xref>). Self-efficacy makes a difference in how people feel, think, and act (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-2" rid="c2">Bandura, 1997</xref>). Recent SCT developments suggest that beliefs about one&#8217;s own abilities to cope help in overcoming difficulties arising after exposure to a traumatic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-2" rid="c3">Benight &amp; Bandura, 2004</xref>). A systematic review confirmed large significant negative associations between self-efficacy and negative consequences of traumatization, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Luszczynska, Benight, &amp; Cieslak, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Secondary Trauma Self-Efficacy</title>
<p align="left">Although multiple studies have shown that self-efficacy explains posttraumatic adaptation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-2" rid="c27">Luszczynska et al., 2009</xref>) and several measures to assess self-efficacy among trauma survivors have been developed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Hyre et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Lambert, Benight, Harrison, &amp; Cieslak, 2012</xref>), we found very few studies investigating self-efficacy or other positive cognitions in the context of secondary exposure to trauma and its consequences. We identified only three studies testing for self-efficacy and health outcomes of secondary trauma exposure.</p>
<p align="left">Among professionals who are at risk for vicarious exposure, self-efficacy is associated with better quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Prati, Pietrantoni, &amp; Cicognani, 2010</xref>), less compassion fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">Ortlepp &amp; Friedman, 2002</xref>) and lower levels of secondary traumatic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Bonach &amp; Heckert, 2012</xref>). It is important to note that those studies assessed work-related self-efficacy, referring to perceptions of training efficiency and perceptions of personal effectiveness at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-2" rid="c5">Bonach &amp; Heckert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-2" rid="c29">Ortlepp &amp; Friedman, 2002</xref>), or assessed general perceptions of the capability to face various challenges at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-2" rid="c32">Prati et al., 2010</xref>). This work-related approach to measure self-efficacy may be an optimal choice to investigate associations between aggravated job stress levels among workers and global consequences of stress (e.g., quality of life, general distress). In contrast, exploring the role of self-efficacy beliefs in the context of secondary trauma exposure and its potential consequences requires evaluating beliefs about the capability to cope with thoughts and feelings related to secondary trauma exposure. As SCT suggests, contexts of self-efficacy should match the specificity of the environment (e.g., types of stressors) and the outcomes. Such an approach is also in line with the optimal matching hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Cutrona, 1990</xref>), indicating the need for testing the role of social cognitive mediators that match the type of stressor and stress outcomes. Therefore, <italic>secondary trauma self-efficacy</italic> (STSE) is defined in this article as perceived ability to cope with the challenging demands resulting from work with traumatized clients and perceived ability to deal with the secondary traumatic stress symptoms.</p>

<title>Aim of the Study</title>
<p align="left">A lack of knowledge about the relationships between self-efficacy and outcomes of secondary trauma exposure among clinical service providers may be due to the fact that no existing measure of self-efficacy is available to assess these relationships. To fill this void, we evaluated the psychometric properties of a newly developed measure of secondary trauma self-efficacy. It was hypothesized that the STSE Scale would have a unidimensional structure, similar to other measures of self-efficacy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-2" rid="c25">Hyre et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Schwarzer &amp; Jerusalem, 1995</xref>). In evaluating the congruent validity of the STSE Scale, we expected that STSE would be moderately or strongly associated with secondary traumatic stress symptoms. As for the discriminant validity, we hypothesized that there would be low to moderate correlations between STSE and other secondary trauma-related cognitions, such as (a) perceived social support, (b) negative cognitions about self and the world, and (c) secondary traumatic growth.</p>
<p align="left">Theory and research suggest that self-efficacy relates to other cognitions and social resources that predict health-related outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-3" rid="c3">Benight &amp; Bandura, 2004</xref>). Self-efficacy may be enhanced by social support, or it may affect social support seeking, thus, indirectly predicting health-related outcomes (cf. enabling and cultivation hypotheses; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Schwarzer &amp; Knoll, 2007</xref>). Therefore, the association between STSE and perceived social support would be expected.</p>
<p align="left">Further, most prominent theoretical frameworks explaining PTSD symptoms (e.g., emotional processing theory; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Foa &amp; Rothbaum, 1998</xref>) assume that negative cognitions about self and the world are key cognitive determinants of the outcomes of the exposure to traumatic stress. However, research has indicated that these negative cognitions operate through other trauma-specific cognitions, such as self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">Cieslak, Benight, &amp; Lehman, 2008</xref>). Therefore, secondary trauma self-efficacy might also be correlated with negative cognitions about self and the world resulting from the indirect exposure to trauma.</p>
<p align="left">Social cognitive theory also implies that strong self-efficacy may enable individuals to identify important opportunities to promote individual growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-3" rid="c2">Bandura, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-4" rid="c3">Benight &amp; Bandura, 2004</xref>). Perceiving positive changes resulting from a struggle with traumatic events and their consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">Calhoun &amp; Tedeschi, 2006</xref>) may represent a positive outcome of posttraumatic adaptation. Perceived posttraumatic growth may be influenced by self-efficacy. In particular, functional outcomes such as perceived growth may develop if survivors start to actively deal with posttraumatic adversities (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">Zoellner &amp; Maercker, 2006</xref>). Such changes and individual growth may occur after secondary trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Arnold, Calhoun, Tedeschi, &amp; Cann, 2005</xref>). Therefore, it was hypothesized that secondary traumatic growth would be associated with STSE.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p align="left">The study was part of a larger project investigating secondary trauma, work-related demands, and resources among mental health care providers working with returning soldiers in the United States. Inclusion criteria for the present study were (a) working at least 1 year as a clinical psychologist, counselor, or social worker; (b) providing services for a military population; and (c) being indirectly exposed to trauma through interaction with patients. Of 312 individuals who responded to any of the items on the STSE Scale, 247 participants (82 men, 33.2%) were qualified for the present study based on the previously described inclusion criteria.</p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-1" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> displays demographic information of the sample. On average, participants were 48.59 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.02). The sample consisted of clinical psychologists (47.0%), counselors or psychotherapists (29.6%), and social workers (23.5%). Participants experienced indirect exposure to different types of traumatic events, including, for example, military combat (89.1%), physical assaults (83.6%), motor vehicle accidents (82.6%), and natural disasters (68.0%). Additionally, all participants were also directly exposed to a traumatic event, with the average number of three traumatic events reported per person (<italic>M</italic> = 3.26, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.84).<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl1"/></p>

<title>Secondary trauma self-efficacy</title>
<p align="left">The items of Secondary Trauma Self-Efficacy (STSE) Scale were developed in three steps. First, three experimenters (licensed psychologists specializing in secondary trauma issues) conducted structured interviews with 30 behavioral health providers exposed to secondary traumatic stress. The interviews aimed at investigating the beliefs about the ability to deal with work-related secondary exposure. Later, the experimenters screened the measures originally designed to assess perceived ability to cope with demands resulting from the exposure to trauma and perceived ability to deal with PTSD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-2" rid="c15">Cieslak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-3" rid="c25">Hyre et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-2" rid="c26">Lambert et al., 2012</xref>). They independently selected up to 12 items, reflecting the self-efficacy statements elicited in the interviews. Seven items were selected by all three experimenters and included in the STSE Scale. The respective items were modified to measure self-efficacy cognitions in the context of indirect exposure to trauma through work with traumatized individuals. In the next step, the experimenters independently screened the interview records for recurring self-efficacy statements that were not covered by the seven items selected in the previous step. Two additional self-efficacy statements were identified using the consensus method and were added to the STSE Scale.</p>
<p align="left">The preliminary version of the STSE Scale consisted of nine items beginning with the same stem phrase &#8220;How capable am I to&#8230;&#8221; followed by the nine items. Participants were asked to relate these items to their &#8220;work with people experiencing extreme or traumatic events.&#8221; The content of the scale is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-1" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Although there are five subscales in the PTGI&#8211;SF measuring different types of changes, a total score index is used the most often measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-2" rid="c13">Cann et al., 2010</xref>). Cronbach&#8217;s alpha in the present study for the total score was .92.</p>

<p align="left">Potential respondents were contacted via an e-mail containing information about the study and the link to the online survey. Off-post providers, who were located in the civilian community, received the e-mail through an online newsletter sent by TriWest Healthcare Alliance, an organization managing health benefits for military patients and their families. On-post providers, who were located at military installations, received the e-mail from the director of the Department of Behavioral Health at Evans Army Community Hospital at Fort Carson, Colorado, and from the Psychology Consultant to the U.S. Army Surgeon General. Respective agencies sent out standard invitation e-mails to all employees who were potential participants and advertised the study in their internal newsletters. The response rate was not available.

<title>Analytical procedures</title>
<p align="left">Missing data for all variables were replaced with hot deck imputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Myers, 2011</xref>). The hot deck imputation replaces a missing value with an existing value of another participant in the same group (deck) as the participant with a missing value. The deck is composed of combinations of levels of categorical variables. The use of the hot deck imputation is optimal even if missing values are not completely at random when missing values are less than 10% of all values (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-2" rid="c28">Myers, 2011</xref>). In total, 0.61% of values were replaced. All of the further analyses were performed on 247 participants.</p>
<p align="left">With gender, intimate relationship status, and profession as categories, Little&#8217;s missing completely at random (MCAR) tests showed that items were missing completely at random for the following scales: the STSE, &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(39) = 19.87, <italic>p</italic> = .99, Secondary Traumatic Growth, &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(40) = 40.81, <italic>p</italic> = .31, and the STSS, &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(94) = 77.78, <italic>p</italic> = .89. The items of the MSPSS and PTCI were not missing completely at random, &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(33) = 55.74, <italic>p</italic> = .01, and &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>(115) = 178.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively.</p>
<p align="left">Using the SPSS Statistics (Version 20), the following statistical procedures were applied: (a) interitem correlations to analyze relationships among the STSE Scale items to eliminate items whose correlations with each other were too high or too low; (b) a principal component analysis to explore possible dimensions of the STSE Scale; (c) Cronbach&#8217;s alpha to assess internal consistency reliability; (d) confirmatory factor analysis to test hypothesized unidimensionality of the scale; (e) corrected item-total correlations and Pearson&#8217;s correlations to test the relationships among STSE and the measures selected to establish validity of the new instrument; and (f) a principal components analysis to examine discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Clark &amp; Watson, 1995</xref>) of the STSE.</p>
<p align="left">The confirmatory factor analysis was performed with AMOS (Version 20). The maximum likelihood was used as an estimation method. Because univariate nonnormality and multivariate nonnormality were diagnosed, a bootstrap procedure was performed with 1,000 bootstrap samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">Byrne, 2009</xref>). Three conventional goodness-of-fit indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-2" rid="c11">Byrne, 2009</xref>) were used to evaluate global model fit: root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), and standardized root-mean residual (SRMR).</p>

<title>Preliminary analyses</title>
<p align="left">Corrected item-total correlations were high (Item 1: <italic>r</italic> = .75, Item 2: <italic>r</italic> = .77, Item 3: <italic>r</italic> = .61, Item 4: <italic>r</italic> = .75, Item 5: <italic>r</italic> = .66, Item 6: <italic>r</italic> = .74, Item 7: <italic>r</italic> = .68, Item 8: <italic>r</italic> = .58, and Item 9: <italic>r</italic> = .65; all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001). Pearson&#8217;s correlations were computed among nine items of the STSE Scale. Results of the correlations revealed that the correlation between Item 1 and Item 2 was high, <italic>r</italic>(245) = .82. This high correlation indicated that these two items may have measured the same aspect of secondary trauma self-efficacy. Therefore, Item 2, &#8220;Deal with the impact these people have had on my life,&#8221; was dropped from further analyses because it was a more general statement than Item 1. After Item 2 was removed from the STSE Scale, Item 6, &#8220;Keep emotional balance after realizing what had happened to these people,&#8221; had high correlations with Items 4, 5, and 7, all <italic>r</italic>s &gt; .65 (<italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001), in addition to a relatively higher corrected item-total correlations with remaining items. These high correlations indicated that Item 6 shared a high percentage of the variance with these three items specifically. Therefore, Item 6 was dropped from further analyses, resulting in seven items on the STSE Scale. The final version of the instrument is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-2" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Corrected item-total correlations for the seven-item version ranged from .53 to .79. Sample distribution analyses showed that the data were negatively skewed for all items, with the distribution differing significantly from normal (<italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Exploratory and confirmatory analysis</title>
<p align="left">A principal components analysis was performed to explore the component structure of the seven items included in the STSE Scale. The analysis extracted one component accounting for 56.89% of the variance (eigenvalue = 3.98) on a basis of the eigenvalue greater than 1 for inclusion of a component. Factor loadings of the items ranged between .71 and .83.</p>
<p align="left">A confirmatory factor analysis for a one-factor unconstrained model showed relatively poor model-data fit, RMSEA = .116, 90% lower and upper confidence limits [.087, .147]; CFI = .936; and SRMR = .047. Modification indices showed that error variances of Items 4 and 5 should covary. The modified model presented good fit with RMSEA of .071, 90% lower and upper confidence limits [037, .106]; CFI of .978; and SRMR of .036. In sum, the results indicated that the seven-item STSE Scale consisted of one component.</p>
<p align="left">A confirmatory factor analysis conducted with the bootstrapping yielded similar fit indices and factor loadings, and therefore suggested good model-data fit. Additional analyses showed that model-data fit was poor (with RMSEA values above .10) when confirmatory factor analyses were conducted for eight-item and nine-item versions of the STSE Scale, with two previously excluded items (2 and 6) taken into account.</p>

<title>Reliability and validity analyses</title>
<p align="left">Internal consistency of the seven-item STSE Scale was &#945; = .87, which suggests good reliability. To examine validity of the STSE scale, we computed Pearson&#8217;s correlations among STSE and theoretically relevant constructs (i.e., secondary traumatic stress, social support, secondary traumatic growth, negative cognitions). As expected, STSE was negatively correlated with secondary traumatic stress and negative cognitions (cf. <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-1" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), with 29.2% shared variance. Consistent with our expectation, STSE was positively correlated with social support. There was a small significant positive correlation between STSE and secondary traumatic growth. Results of partial correlation analyses (with the number of direct trauma exposures controlled) indicated that the associations between STSE and the other study variables remained significant and similar in size (<xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-2" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl2"/></p>
<p align="left">To examine discriminant validity of the STSE Scale, we performed a principal components analysis with the seven items of the STSE Scale and the randomly selected seven STSS items. Based on eigenvalue greater than 1 as the inclusion criterion, we identified two components accounting for a total of 55.82% of the variance (eigenvalue = 7.81). One component consisted of the seven items of the STSE Scale (factor loadings ranging from .69 to .80), and the other component consisted of the seven STSS items (factor loadings ranging from .51 to .84).</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p align="left">The results of Study 1 provided preliminary support for validity and reliability of the STSE Scale, as well as for its unifactorial structure. As data were collected cross-sectionally, the time stability of the scale was not tested. Moreover, participants worked with a specific population (i.e., traumatized military patients). A longitudinal cross-validation study conducted in a different sample of professionals (i.e., indirectly exposed to civilian-related traumas) was needed. To rectify these limitations, we designed Study 2 to longitudinally evaluate the psychometric properties of the STSE Scale among workers providing services to traumatized civilian population within a different cultural context (in Poland). Extending the findings of Study 1, Study 2 provided a cross-cultural cross-validation study.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p align="left">Health care and social workers providing services for civilian survivors of traumatic events participated in the research. The study was a part of a larger investigation focusing on determinants of how job demands and resources contribute to development of secondary traumatic stress. Inclusion criteria for the present study were (a) working at least 1 year as a health care provider (nurse or paramedic) or social worker; (b) providing services for a civilian population suffering from trauma; and (c) being indirectly exposed to trauma through interaction with patients or clients. Of 309 participants, three participants were excluded because they reported having no exposure to potential secondary traumatic events; this resulted in a sample of 306 participants (71 men, 23.2%). <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-3" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> displays demographic information of the sample. The mean age was 35.41 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.59) at Time 1. The sample consisted of 148 health care providers (48.4%), 115 social workers (37.6%), and 39 other professionals (12.3%). A lower average education level among Study 2 participants compared with those in Study1 resulted from the differences in the occupations and the national regulations pertaining to the academic degree required for registered practice. In particular, 47% of Study 1 participants were clinical psychologists, who are required to have a doctorate degree in order to practice, whereas the majority of Study 2 participants were nurses and social workers who are required to have a bachelor&#8217;s or master&#8217;s degree in order to practice their profession. Participants were indirectly exposed to different types of traumatic events at work, including life-threatening illness or injury (88.9%); physical assault (87.3%); sudden, unexpected death of someone close (82.7%); transportation accident (73.2%); natural disaster (30.1%); or military-related trauma (9.5%). Additionally, 75% of respondents reported that they experienced a direct exposure to traumatic event at least once. The number of direct exposures to trauma was not assessed.</p>
<p align="left">Of those 306 participants who completed the Time 1 assessment, 193 (37 men, 19.2%) took part in Time 2 measurement (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-4" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for demographics). Attrition analysis showed no significant differences between completers and dropouts in terms of age, items of the STSE Scale, and the STSE Scale total score (<italic>t</italic>s &lt; 1.47, <italic>ns</italic>), as well as relationship status and education (&#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>s &lt; 4.78, <italic>ns</italic>).

<title>Measures</title>
<p align="left">Participants completed the same set of measures as in Study 1, such as (a) Secondary Trauma Self-Efficacy Scale (&#945; = .88); (b) Secondary Trauma Exposure Scale; (c) Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (&#945;s = .93 for a total score and .79 for Intrusion, .85 for Avoidance, and .87 for Arousal Symptoms subscales); (d) Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (&#945;s = .96 for a total score and .96 for Support From Family, .96 for Support From Friends, and .93 for Support From Significant Others subscales); and the short form of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (&#945; = .92). The Secondary Trauma Exposure Scale in Study 2 assessed whether participants have experienced directly any of the 10 traumatic events. The scale measuring the negative cognitions about the world and self was not included. The Polish versions of the scales were prepared using back-translation procedures. As in Study 1, participants were asked to respond to the items in the context of work-related indirect exposure to trauma.</p>

Those who were interested were informed about the study aims; they then provided informed consent and filled out the questionnaires. Six months later, respondents received an e-mail invitation to take part in Time 2 measurement. The mean time elapsed between Time 1 and Time 2 surveys was 162.26 days (<italic>SD</italic> = 39.35).

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p align="left">Our studies evaluated the characteristics of the Secondary Trauma Self-Efficacy (STSE) Scale, a measure designed to capture beliefs about the ability to deal with barriers associated with secondary exposure to trauma. This short seven-item scale tackles the barriers of tasks at work (including providing services to trauma survivors), but it also refers to controlling emotional and cognitive reactions related to the indirect exposure. Compared with other measures of self-efficacy that were previously applied in the context of exposure to secondary trauma, the STSE Scale is specific to challenges posed by the indirect exposure to trauma, including environmental (i.e., work-related) and individual (cognitive and emotional) demands. As proposed in SCT, self-efficacy beliefs, which make a difference in specific stressful situations, should closely reflect the demands related to this situation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-4" rid="c2">Bandura, 1997</xref>). Further, in line with optimal matching hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-2" rid="c17">Cutrona, 1990</xref>), the scale matching both stressful demands and stress outcomes may offer the best approach to investigating self-efficacy related to secondary exposure.</p>
<p align="left">Results of the present studies supported the one-factor structure of the STSE Scale and its good reliability. Factor analyses comparing the two language versions indicated the invariant structure of the scale. Such structure is in line with SCT, assuming that self-efficacy is a one-dimensional construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-5" rid="c2">Bandura, 1997</xref>). Unifactorial structure of other types of self-efficacy, such as general self-efficacy or self-efficacy referring to coping with one&#8217;s own trauma, were also confirmed in studies testing psychometric characteristics of other self-efficacy measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-4" rid="c25">Hyre et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-3" rid="c26">Lambert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-2" rid="c34">Schwarzer &amp; Jerusalem, 1995</xref>). Further, self-efficacy referring to secondary trauma, measured with the STSE Scale, showed high stability over 6 months. According to SCT, moderate to high stability may be expected, because self-efficacy may fluctuate over time due to mastery experiences over environmental and intrapersonal challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-6" rid="c2">Bandura, 1997</xref>). In sum, the results provide evidence for good psychometric properties of the scale and verify its theoretically assumed structure.</p>
<p align="left">In both studies, secondary trauma self-efficacy was related to the selected constructs, as hypothesized. The negative associations between STSE and secondary traumatic stress were significant and moderate, indicating that beliefs about ability to deal with challenges related to secondary trauma exposure are important in predicting lower levels of secondary traumatic stress. The size of correlation coefficients corresponds to associations between self-efficacy and health outcomes reported in meta-analyses dealing with survivors of primary trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-3" rid="c27">Luszczynska et al., 2009</xref>). In the only other study testing for associations between secondary traumatic stress and self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-3" rid="c5">Bonach &amp; Heckert, 2012</xref>), researchers applying a measure of efficacy that referred to respondents&#8217; own role and efficiency at work found weak associations, and only 1% of secondary traumatic stress variance was explained. In contrast, self-efficacy measured with STSE Scale explains 23%&#8211;39% of variance in secondary traumatic stress. In conclusion, the STSE Scale showed a potential to help explain the psychological distress process among workers exposed to secondary trauma.</p>
<p align="left">The correlations between secondary trauma self-efficacy and other trauma-related cognitions such as negative cognitions about self and about the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-2" rid="c22">Foa &amp; Rothbaum, 1998</xref>) and secondary traumatic growth were significant (higher self-efficacy was associated with less negative cognitions and with higher growth) and in the low to moderate range. Therefore, the amount of variance shared between these variables was not high, confirming that STSE and other constructs are distinct aspects of cognitive functioning after secondary exposure to trauma. Similar strength of associations between self-efficacy and cognitions about self and the world was found in research dealing with victims of primary exposure to trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-3" rid="c15">Cieslak et al., 2008</xref>). We have identified no other study showing associations between self-efficacy and cognitions about self and the world in the context of secondary trauma exposure; therefore, our findings provide a preliminary novel evidence for the interplay between positive and negative cognitions among professionals exposed to secondary trauma. Future research should investigate if these general negative cognitions operate through trauma-specific cognitions, such as STSE.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, secondary trauma self-efficacy measured with the STSE Scale was moderately related to higher levels of social support from family, friends, and other significant sources. The findings are in line with posttraumatic adaptation model assuming that social resources should foster self-efficacy beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-5" rid="c3">Benight &amp; Bandura, 2004</xref>) as well as in line with models explaining associations between social support and cognitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-2" rid="c35">Schwarzer &amp; Knoll, 2007</xref>). Further, models explaining factors affecting practitioners working with clients exposed to trauma focused solely on support from work-related sources (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-2" rid="c38">Voss Horrell et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings suggest that support from sources outside work may also play a relevant role. As two previous studies accounting for self-efficacy and social support among professionals exposed to secondary trauma did not test for the associations between these constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-4" rid="c5">Bonach &amp; Heckert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-3" rid="c29">Ortlepp &amp; Friedman, 2002</xref>), no comparison between our results and previous research can be made. Our findings, therefore, provide novel preliminary evidence for the relationship between self-efficacy and support from sources outside work.</p>
<p align="left">In sum, the present research provides evidence for the validity of the STSE Scale. All hypothesized associations of secondary trauma self-efficacy with the secondary traumatic stress, negative cognitions, secondary traumatic growth, and perceived social support were confirmed. The sizes of correlation coefficients were similar in both language versions of the STSE Scale. Future studies are needed to further evaluate whether the STSE Scale is a superior predictor of adaptation after secondary exposure to trauma, compared with other measures of self-efficacy, such as general self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-3" rid="c34">Schwarzer &amp; Jerusalem, 1995</xref>) or work-related efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-5" rid="c5">Bonach &amp; Heckert, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">The strength of our research lies in testing the STSE Scale properties in two different contexts. Similar patterns of associations emerged from data collected in the United States and Poland, and the two language versions showed similar psychometric properties. The findings were similar for workers exposed to civilian-related secondary trauma and those who were exposed to secondary trauma through providing services to military personnel. These results indicate that the STSE Scale is a robust measure and allow for a preliminary conclusion that secondary trauma self-efficacy may have similar properties and operate similarly across different cultural contexts. Further research is needed to investigate individuals in different types of occupations, such as oncology nurses or juvenile justice education workers, who may suffer from relatively high levels of secondary traumatic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-2" rid="c8">Bride et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-2" rid="c18">Dominguez-Gomez &amp; Rutledge, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-2" rid="c23">Hatcher et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">The utility of the STSE Scale in secondary trauma experiences that are unrelated to work, such as secondary trauma exposure reported by partners of cancer patients or spouses of military service members, may be low. Three items of the STSE Scale refer to barriers experienced due to working with traumatized individuals. Further, a reference to interaction with other people at work may not be ideal in case of some professionals exposed to secondary trauma, such as clergy members (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Hendron, Irving, &amp; Taylor, 2012</xref>). The phrase &#8220;working with these people&#8221; could be replaced with &#8220;interacting with these people,&#8221; but other versions of the STSE Scale with language adjustments would require additional psychometric evaluations.</p>
<p align="left">Our research has some limitations. Data were collected among relatively heterogeneous samples, but several occupational groups that may suffer from relatively high secondary traumatic stress were not included (e.g., emergency nurses or juvenile justice system workers; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-3" rid="c18">Dominguez-Gomez &amp; Rutledge, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-3" rid="c23">Hatcher et al., 2011</xref>). Although both studies applied multiple recruitment strategies in order to reach diverse target populations, these are both convenience samples. Future research needs to account for the representativeness of the samples.</p>
<p align="left">The utility of the STSE Scale was not compared with the utility of other measures of self-efficacy. The instructions in the original measures assessing social support, growth, and negative cognitions were modified in order to tackle participants&#8217; functioning in the context of work-related secondary exposure. Changing more general measures (i.e., referring to any type of trauma exposure or any type of stressful event) into specific measures by means of narrowing down the instructions might inflate the observed associations between the constructs. The number of situations of direct exposure to traumatic events was not evaluated in Study 2. Future research needs to account for other occupational groups, different types of self-efficacy, and other stress outcomes, such as job burnout or diminished quality of life. Studies aiming at further psychometric evaluation of the STSE Scale may consider including additional items to assure that the STSE concept is covered in a sufficiently broad way. On the other hand, short versions of the STSE Scale may be needed for multivariate investigations. Future studies need to clarify how the secondary trauma self-efficacy construct may operate and whether it influences practitioners&#8217; well-being and their effectiveness at work. Developing a psychometrically sound measure of the secondary trauma self-efficacy was an essential step preceding research on evaluating mechanisms and the effects of secondary trauma self-efficacy.</p>
<p align="left">The present study investigated the properties of a new measure of self-efficacy, referring to coping with secondary trauma experiences. The data collected among professionals working with civilians and military trauma victims indicated good psychometric characteristics of the STSE Scale and its invariance for two language versions. The interest in research on secondary traumatic stress is growing as organizations and practitioners call for identifying protective factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-4" rid="c20">Elwood et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-2" rid="c37">Tyson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-3" rid="c38">Voss Horrell et al., 2011</xref>). Secondary trauma self-efficacy may constitute one of the key protective individual resources, promoting well-being and operating in concert with other individual and environmental resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-4" rid="c27">Luszczynska et al., 2009</xref>). Our research proposes a new measure to assess this personal resource.</p>
