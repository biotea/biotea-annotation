<p align="left">A reaction time/accuracy experiment investigated the development of visual memory for object shape and location in 6&#8211;7- and 8&#8211;9-year-old children and adults (<italic>N</italic> = 72) in three array types: (1) an empty screen, (2) a frame delineating a region, and (3) a grid with individually delineated places. A maximized learning design was used. Explicit array boundaries in the frame and in the grid facilitated place memory in both children and adults, while place memory in the empty screen was less correct, slower, and did not improve. Children&#8217;s visual memory was initially low, but learning during the task resulted in better object than place memory. Like the children at the end of the session, adults showed better object than place memory at the beginning of the task. They subsequently also improved their object memory, but doubled their place memory performance. Children with object-region binding showed better place memory and more systematic learning effects that were specific to arrays. However, neither array boundaries nor spatial binding concepts explained the absence of place learning in children. Instead, children tried to prevent proactive shape interference in the repeated memory sets at the cost of place learning, while adults did not.</p>

<p align="left">Piaget and Inhelder (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr80-1" rid="c80">Piaget &amp; Inhelder, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr81-1" rid="c81">Piaget, Inhelder, &amp; Szeminska, 1960</xref>) were two Swiss psychologists who conducted many experiments on the development of the concept of space using verbal interviews, drawings, and real-life settings. In short, they believed that children&#8217;s concept of space would develop from an early topological system, in which objects in space would be the anchors for measurement (figurative thinking), to a projective system, in which space is measured using vectors that conceptualize metric three-dimensional space (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">Lange-K&#252;ttner &amp; Reith, 1995</xref>). This developmental process was also conceptualized as a transition from object-place binding to objects-region binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1" rid="c46">2010b</xref>). Along with the conceptualization of area, from age 9, area boundaries come to the attention of children as spatial constraints regulating expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1" rid="c44">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, information processing speed increases exponentially at that age (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Kail, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">2000</xref>) &#8211; a factor that was not measured by Piaget and Inhelder. So, which is the most important variable for the development of spatial memory: the ready-made segmentation of an array with explicit boundaries, children&#8217;s own spatial conceptualizations, or information processing speed? The present study investigates the impact of array boundaries on visual memory for object shape and location in three different spatial arrays with increasing amounts of explicit boundaries. It was also analyzed how much children&#8217;s spatial memory increased during the session.</p>

<title>Array Effects</title>

<p align="left">One of <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr80-2" rid="c80">Piaget and Inhelder&#8217;s (1956</xref>) most intriguing experiments to prove the absence of a projective space concept in young children was a task in which children were supposed to line up figures diagonally on a rectangular table to connect two points, A and B. Until the age of 4, children were not able to distribute the figures evenly between Points A and B, but clustered figures in close proximity to each other (Stage 1). Between ages 4 and 7 years, children used the edge of the table corner as an external cue to line up the figures, but this obviously did not result in a diagonal across the table (Stage 2). At this stage, the boundaries of the table acted as both an orthogonal interference distracting from the diagonal and as a facilitator for the construction of a figure line-up instead of building a cluster of figures. Not until age 7 did children increasingly attempt to free themselves from the external support of the table edges and construct the correct diagonal figure line-up between Points A and B (Stage 3). Follow-up research confirmed that the conceptualization of the diagonal emerges late (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-1" rid="c74">Olson, 1970</xref>), for example, when regulating object size in a perspective system where spatial axes diagonally converge into one viewpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-2" rid="c44">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p align="left">Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-1" rid="c79">Piaget (1969</xref>) assumed that the ability to create a vector requires the abandonment of figurative thinking as objects become just points in mathematical space. Indeed, recent research showed that, while adults mainly relied on boundary information in spatial memory, children used both landmarks and boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Bullens et al., 2010</xref>). A mix of landmark and boundary information in a display, however, was the most difficult for adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Bird, Capponi, King, Doeller, &amp; Burgess, 2010</xref>). Adults were most accurate in coding more pristine angular information, which indicated the use of metric vector space information, while children used distance as a spatial cue, which showed that they centered their attention on objects and their spatial relations to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-2" rid="c7">Bullens, et al., 2010</xref>). The present study used only boundary information; no landmarks were offered in the arrays as visual cues.</p>

<p align="left">Vectors are spatial axes that we construct in our minds, while spatial boundaries can be directly perceived. However, this distinction may be on a graded scale, as the &#8220;reheating&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Cowan &amp; Chen, 2009</xref>) of what we see into what we conceptualize may be a fluid process. For instance, increasing the number of visible boundaries in a spatial array did not change the amount of activation in the hippocampal area in the brain, but the conjuring up of these boundaries in spatial imagery, that is in a mental representation of what was seen, did result in the expected activation with increasing amounts of spatial boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-2" rid="c6">Bird et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p align="left">Long-term memory for array boundaries seems to be functional in animals, infants, and children alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1" rid="c54">Lew, 2011</xref>). For instance, when 3&#8211;4-year-old children were to re-orient themselves in different spatial arrays and search for an object, they were more successful when explicit spatial boundaries, either drawn, or slightly elevated like a rim, delimited an area (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-1" rid="c52">Lee &amp; Spelke, 2011</xref>). In 7&#8211;9-year-old children, explicit grid boundaries in a real-life three-dimensional space box shaped their place memory: Children were more likely to remember the places of equidistant objects as closer together when they were located within the boundary of a common area than in a neighboring area (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Hund &amp; Plumert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Hund, Plumert, &amp; Benney, 2002</xref>). This more densely clustered place memory occurred even though these common boundaries were no longer present at test.</p>

<p align="left">Likewise, a recent computerized study on visual memory development showed that the experience of a grid where each place was marked by explicit spatial boundaries had a long-term facilitation effect in a second session when the places were not individually marked anymore (<italic>spatial array priming</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-2" rid="c46">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2010b</xref>). Hence, the experience of explicit spatial boundaries was a powerful facilitator for children&#8217;s memory of objects&#8217; locations. In the present study, three arrays with an increasing amount of explicit spatial boundaries were used: One array was just the empty computer screen without any explicit boundaries; in the second array, an area was delimited with a frame; and in the third array, each individual place was delimited with a grid. Participants experienced only one array type in a between-subjects design in order to prevent priming influences among the three array types.</p>

<title>Spatial Concepts</title>

<p align="left">The development of spatial concepts was also framed with a binding approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr106-1" rid="c106">Zimmer, Mecklinger, &amp; Lindenberger, 2006</xref>). Object shape and object location have a double representation in the neocortex (<italic>what-and-where system</italic>). On the one hand, two posterior brain areas&#8211;which are relatively distant from each other&#8211;selectively process shape features such as color and contour (temporal lobe or <italic>what system</italic>) versus location distribution (parietal lobe or <italic>where system</italic>). On the other hand, there are two adjacent areas in the frontal lobe that also process shapes and location (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr65-1" rid="c65">Mecklinger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-1" rid="c67">Mecklinger &amp; Meinshausen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-1" rid="c68">Mecklinger &amp; M&#252;ller, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-1" rid="c69">Mecklinger &amp; Pfeifer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr104-1" rid="c104">Wilson, Scalaidhe, &amp; Goldman-Rakic, 1993</xref>). This second spatial system in the frontal lobe is dedicated to executive processes such as maintenance, inhibition, and transformations during delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">D&#8217;Esposito, Postle, &amp; Rypma, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr76-1" rid="c76">Owen, Stern, Look, Tracey, Rosen, &amp; Petrides, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr97-1" rid="c97">Smith &amp; Jonides, 1999</xref>). Thus, while shape and place percepts are initially encoded separately, these percepts are processed further through binding as well as unbinding, or de-correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2008c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr71-1" rid="c71">Murre, Wolters, &amp; Raffone, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p align="left">Research using the binding approach was also investigated with a drawing task using a Wertheimer array of dots where pairs were either similar in appearance or more proximal to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr77-1" rid="c77">Palmer, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-1" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>  shows that young children allocated one location to each object (<italic>object-place binding</italic>), but from about age 7, they began to allocate regions to matching objects (<italic>object-region binding</italic>) (Common Region Test, CRT; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-2" rid="c40">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2006</xref>). Object-place binding predicted better object memory of 4&#8211;6-year-old children, while the allocation of a common region to matching objects predicted better place memory of 7&#8211;10-year-old children (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-2" rid="c45">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-3" rid="c46">2010b</xref>). Hence, young children&#8217;s object-place binding increased the memory precision for each individual target and this resulted in improved object memory, while their common region coding when older made the most of their capacity via visuospatial chunking, and this resulted in improved place memory.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig1"/></p>

<p align="left">Even more intriguing, the aforementioned facilitation and shaping of place memory by seeing a grid which denoted individual places in a first session (<italic>array priming) </italic>became statistically non-significant when children&#8217;s spatial binding strategies were considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-4" rid="c46">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2010b</xref>). Hence, in children, the experience of explicit spatial boundaries in the array itself and an advanced spatial concept of common region both facilitated place memory in the same way. The ability to draw spatial boundaries for spatial regions would potentially also facilitate the parsing of a spatial array with a high density of shapes into clearly delimited smaller regions&#8211;this is a major problem for children with ADHD, who are less prone to restrict their visual attention to a limited spatial area (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr91-1" rid="c91">Shalev &amp; Tsal, 2003</xref>).</p>

<p align="left">Another reason that a region facilitates memory for places may be that it requires the formation of a visual pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">De Ribaupierre &amp; Bailleux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr101-1" rid="c101">Uttal &amp; Chiong, 2004</xref>). Visual pattern memory shows a strong growth rate in middle childhood when stimuli are presented simultaneously, but develops at a slower pace when the visual pattern needs to be gradually built up from a stimulus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-1" rid="c56">Logie, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr82-1" rid="c82">Pickering, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr83-1" rid="c83">Pickering, Gathercole, Hall, &amp; Lloyd, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr89-1" rid="c89">Schumann-Hengsteler, Strobl, &amp; Zoelch, 2004</xref>). This gradual build-up from a stimulus sequence (learning) was investigated in the present study.</p>

<title>Spatial Learning</title>

<p align="left">Objects have many context-dependent features such as location, projective size, and color appearance at different distances and illuminations (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">Bar &amp; Neta, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-1" rid="c66">Mecklinger, Gruenewald, Weiskopf, &amp; Doeller, 2004</xref>). However, despite changing appearances, an object shape is immediately recognizable and memorable (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Biederman, Yue, &amp; Davidoff, 2009</xref>). Objects&#8217; shapes were also relatively well-remembered by young children, but places were not (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-3" rid="c45">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-5" rid="c46">2010b</xref>). However, research with monkeys showed that considerable place learning occurred due to repetition and practice of one task (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Harlow, 1949</xref>). A recent meta-analysis of 188 research studies showed that repeated practice of the same task proved to be the better method of increasing spatial learning compared to training on several different spatial tasks, with nearly double the effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr102-1" rid="c102">Uttal et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

<p align="left">It is assumed that two types of spatial learning exist: one fast yet lasting as in spatial priming, the other slow and laborious. While holistic snapshot-like learning in the hippocampus occurs fast and is enduring even from the experience of a single presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-1" rid="c62">McClelland, McNaughton, &amp; O&#8217;Reilly, 1995</xref>), the learning of associations between stimuli in the neocortex occurs more slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-1" rid="c72">O&#8217;Reilly &amp; Rudy, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr73-1" rid="c73">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr105-1" rid="c105">Yonelinas, Hopfinger, Buonocore, Kroll, &amp; Baynes, 2001</xref>). Fast learning was tested with varying degrees of explicitness of spatial boundaries in three spatial arrays that would provide some immediate, ready-made, gestalt-like perceptual input. Slow learning was tested by analyzing the gradual improvement and learning during the experimental blocks. Indeed, one important facilitation mechanism in memory formation is repeated stimulus exposure, both in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">Druker &amp; Anderson, 2010</xref>) and in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Bauer, 1997</xref>), similar to neural networks in which repeated exposure leads to learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-1" rid="c63">McClelland &amp; Siegler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-1" rid="c64">McLeod, Plunkett, &amp; Rolls, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr93-1" rid="c93">Siegler, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr94-1" rid="c94">2004</xref>). In repeated viewing, sampling of visual object features occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Hollingworth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Hollingworth &amp; Henderson, 2002</xref>). In children, an effect of repeated viewing was previously found in landmark learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr87-1" rid="c87">Presson, 1987</xref>) and in mental rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Kail, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Kail &amp; Park, 1990</xref>). However, Kail found that he was not training children in the psychological process of mental rotation as such, but instead they learned to rotate only one particular object. Hence, Kail concluded that <italic>instance-based learning </italic>had occurred, demonstrating the importance of individual objects for children.</p>

<p align="left">A maximized-learning design was used by recruiting participants who had ample room for improvement, that is, school-aged children and female undergraduate students, both from low-income areas. It was expected that while initial performance levels would be low because performance in some spatial tasks is associated with both social class and gender (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-4" rid="c45">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1" rid="c53">Levine, Vasilyeva, Lourenco, Newcombe, &amp; Huttenlocher, 2005</xref>), considerable place learning should occur during the task.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="s5">

<title>Information Processing Speed</title>

<p align="left">Information processing speed is yet another factor that changes with age, particularly after the onset of schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Kail, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-2" rid="c31">2000</xref>). Kail viewed information processing speed as a global factor that constrains performance across many tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">Kail, 1996</xref>). Also, for spatial learning, information processing speed may be a crucial factor. For instance, 10-year-old children and 73-year-old adults needed long presentation times for higher accuracy when they were to recognize changes in the appearance of a single shape, but even more so when the appearance of several shapes in different locations in the spatial array changed at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-1" rid="c61">Mayr, Kliegl, &amp; Krampe, 1996</xref>). Hence, according to the association-dissociation-association (ADA) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-2" rid="c43">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2008c</xref>), in young children with limited information processing speed, object shapes enter the information processing system along with object places, but only shapes can be retrieved successfully because of their visual discriminability. The model refers to Treisman&#8217;s theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr99-1" rid="c99">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr100-1" rid="c100">2006</xref>) that objects&#8217; places are included in an &#8220;object file&#8221; along with other features such as color and shape.</p>

<p align="left">Thus, the ADA model assumes that young children are not yet able to process places as such, that is, dissociate the place from the object itself. For this to happen, it could be that information processing would need to be faster so that places, too, could be entered as units into a visual pattern that is more abstract than an array of figures. Only when the places of objects have become just locations, it would become possible to neatly organize and locate them in a spatial system without the ballast and burden of the shape of their occupant.</p>

<title>The Present Study</title>

<p align="left">The present study employed a microgenetic analysis of spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr93-2" rid="c93">Siegler, 2000</xref>). Spatial learning was investigated with an extensive within-subject experimental design involving two memory sets that were repeatedly tested for object and place memory. It is possible to flexibly allocate attention to either object shape or object location, depending on instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Cohen, Pinto, Howe, &amp; Horowitz, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p align="left">The first hypothesis concerned the different degree of facilitation that each spatial array would provide. An empty expanse was expected to be the most challenging as no explicit spatial structure was provided. In comparison, a frame would narrow down the search area and thus constrain the number of possible locations on the screen where an object could appear and disappear. The grid was expected to be the most supportive array because each individual place was clearly delimited and the regular boundaries of the grid would facilitate categorical (left-right, up-down) spatial relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Kosslyn, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Kosslyn, Flynn, Amsterdam, &amp; Wang, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr86-1" rid="c86">Postma, Kessels, &amp; Van Asselen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr88-1" rid="c88">Schneider, Gruber, Gold, &amp; Opwis, 1993</xref>).</p>

<p align="left">The second hypothesis concerned spatial learning during the task. Young children were found to be better in object than in place memory, but place memory improved from 7 years on (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-5" rid="c45">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-6" rid="c46">2010b</xref>). Was this the case because the older children had the better <italic>a priori</italic> spatial concepts, or did this occur because older children were more resourceful and improved more in place learning during the experiment than the younger children? If the latter was the case, age differences were expected to be more pronounced for place learning during the experiment than for object shape memory (age by object/place memory by learning). Furthermore, it was investigated whether the spatial concepts in the CRT test (object-place vs. objects-region binding by learning) or an acceleration of reactions during the task (acceleration by learning) or the explicit spatial boundaries in the three arrays (array by learning) were responsible for the improvement in place recognition.</p>

<title>Apparatus</title>

<p align="left">Sets of objects-in-places (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr86-2" rid="c86">Postma et al., 2004</xref>) were presented in a recognition task. A computer task was programmed using the software Experimental Run Time System (ERTS; BeriSoft Cooperation, Frankfurt). A desktop DOS 486 computer with a 15-inch monitor was used. A large, custom-made, one-button keypad connected to an ERTSKEY relay via the printer port of the PC was used for testing. It was able to be operated with the flat hand rather than a finger. The task was designed as a go/no-go task with only one response key to avoid left/right response errors, in particular in children. The go/no-go task involved a response only in the case of a target, while no response was necessary in the case of a distracter.</p>

<p align="left">The identical task was given in three different arrays (see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc2-1" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) using a between-subjects design, that is, each participant took part in only one session. In the empty condition, no array was shown, but the presentation surface consisted of the entire screen. In the frame condition, a square of 12 by 12 cm was presented in the center of the screen, delimiting the area in which shapes could appear. In the grid condition, the same frame was used and, in addition, the nine individual object locations were explicitly marked, each place measuring 4 by 4 cm. Frame and grid were constantly present, while shapes appeared and disappeared.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig2"/></p>

<p align="left">One experimental block consisted of presentation, delay, and test, with timings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc3-1" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Items in the presentation, the delay, and in the test were in a sequence randomized for each participant by the experimental software.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig3"/></p>

<p align="left">In the presentation, participants saw five geometric shapes that appeared and then disappeared, one at a time, in a randomized sequence, in the respective spatial array condition to which participants were allocated. They only had to watch.</p>

<p align="left">Thereafter, they carried out a delay task consisting of six trials showing a black animal silhouette. Participants were asked to make a perceptual judgment in the delay trials, either in terms of size (big/small, &#8220;size delay&#8221;) or movement (top/bottom, &#8220;position delay&#8221;). The size delay task involved animals that were of the same size on the screen (standardized average size: 3.91 cm<sup location="post">2</sup>), but of very different size in reality, such as an ant or grasshopper versus a rhinoceros or elephant. Children had to press the button when an animal was big. The other delay task involved judging whether birds were flying on top or at the bottom across the screen and a button press was required when they were flying on top. Each memory set (see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-1" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) was tested four times, in a 2 (Object/Place) &#215; 2 (Size/Position delay) design. This way, delay tasks were counterbalanced for object and place memory.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig4"/></p>

<p align="left">Finally, in the test, the five presentation items (targets) plus four distracter items were shown. In the place test, a location was tested with a placeholder (star), while in the object test, the shape was presented in the center of the screen. In total, each participant experienced 144 test trials (9 test items &#215; (2 &#215; 2 tests) per memory set &#215; 4 blocks).</p>

<p align="left">Interstimulus interval and number of delay items were the same for adults and children. Durations of stimulus presentation and test items were longer for children in order to support their memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr95-1" rid="c95">Simpson &amp; Riggs, 2006</xref>). Pressing the response key terminated the presentation of a test item to reward speed and released a smiling or frowning feedback face for 1000 ms, followed by a 3000 ms pause before the next trial.</p>

<p align="left">The memory sets of the four blocks are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-2" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Objects in the memory sets consisted of simple shapes, that is, a circle, a rectangle, a square, an oval, a half moon, a cross, a star, a diamond, and an arc. All items were created using drawing software (Harvard Graphics) and were used before in research on object and place memory by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-2" rid="c67">Mecklinger and Meinshausen (1998</xref>). The colors were green (RGB 120/100/60) and red (RGB 100/0/0; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-2" rid="c68">Mecklinger &amp; M&#252;ller, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>

<p align="left">Children and adults were tested individually. For children, the session began with the Common Region Task (CRT) in order to assess spatial binding. The Wertheimer dots of the CRT were printed on an A4-sized sheet of paper. In the first row, dots were equidistant and identical in appearance; in the second row, pairs of dots were closer to each other; and in the third row, dots were again equidistant, but pairs of dots were similar in appearance, either pairs of filled or unfilled black circles (see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-2" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, upper left). The instruction was &#8220;Please draw a circle around the dots that you think belong together.&#8221; There was no time limit on this task. Children drew circles until all dots had been accommodated. Only the second and third rows of the finished product with the pairs of dots were coded. When each dot was circled individually, this was scored as object-place binding; when matching pairs were circled, this was evaluated as object-region binding. All other types were evaluated as unsystematic binding (see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-3" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Coding of the CRT was straightforward and double-checked without any mistakes being found.</p>

<p align="left">The children&#8217;s memory test took about 30 minutes, the faster-paced adult session about 15 minutes. Participants were familiarized with the respective array, stimuli, feedback, and response key with a programmed introductory tutorial. All children heard the same sentences in the introduction because they were read aloud from a series of screenshots (introductory sentences in quotations marks): <italic>Intro Presentation:</italic> &#8220;A spatial array will appear on the screen.&#8221; &#8220;In the array, shapes will appear in this way:&#8221; The respective array then appeared on the next screen, with an oval shape appearing within the array and then disappearing, and the array staying on screen briefly thereafter. <italic>Intro Test:</italic> This demonstration was followed by the information &#8220;The task will be to remember either the SHAPES or their LOCATIONS.&#8221; The same appearance-disappearance of the oval followed, but this time the experimenter pointed toward the shape, and toward the empty location after the shape had disappeared. <italic>Intro Delay Tasks:</italic> This was followed by the introduction of the delay tasks &#8220;In between there will be some tasks on animals, like this:&#8221; On the next two screens an ant and a camel were shown and participants answered &#8220;small&#8221; and &#8220;big,&#8221; respectively. Thereafter, an owl was flying along the upper and lower edge of the screen, and participants were required to say whether the owl was flying at the top or at the bottom of the screen. They were informed that they should only press the button when an animal was big, or flying on top of the screen. <italic>Intro Response Key:</italic> Children were offered to press the key with the read-out words &#8220;With the push button you can reply, when something is correct. Try it!&#8221; When the child pressed the button, the feedback smiley appeared in the center of the screen and it was explained that this indicated that the correct button was pressed. The feedback smiley with the turned-down mouth for wrong responses was not shown but mentioned. <italic>Intro Start:</italic> On the next screen they were asked &#8220;Are you ready to begin?&#8221; After their positive response, the experiment was started.</p>

<p align="left">Also in the experimental phase, instructions appeared in a standardized fashion on the computer screen and again the experimenter read the computerized instructions aloud to the children, see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-3" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. <italic>Presentation:</italic> Shapes will now appear on the screen. You only have to watch. Please remember the SHAPES (LOCATIONS) as best as you can. <italic>Size Delay:</italic> &#8220;Are these animals really big? If yes, please press the push button!&#8221; <italic>Position Delay:</italic> &#8220;Are these animals flying on top of the screen? If yes, please press the push button!&#8221; <italic>Object Test:</italic> &#8220;Have you seen these SHAPES in the last array? If yes, press the push button.&#8221; <italic>Place Test:</italic> &#8220;Were those PLACES occupied where stars will appear now? If yes, press the push button.&#8221;</p>

<title>Data Generation</title>

<p align="left">In the delay tasks, responses aborted the presentation of the delay items. Hence, for participants who responded more quickly in the go trials (big animals and animals flying at the top of the screen), the delay was slightly shorter. In contrast, no-go trials (small animals and animals flying at the bottom of the screen) consisted of the non-abbreviated animal presentation, which did not require a response. Wrong button presses occurred very rarely but could also produce a reaction time for no-go trials, and a full duration for go trials. Thus, the exact delay duration was computed for each participant (real-time delay) (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1" rid="c47">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2012</xref>) by adding up the response trial latencies plus the 1000 ms feedback, non-abbreviated trials with the full 4800 ms presentation, as well as the constant of a 3000 ms pause after each trial. The mean duration of the size judgment delay was <italic>M</italic> = 40,312 ms and that of the position judgment delay was <italic>M</italic> = 40,783 ms.</p>

<p align="left">Because <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Hayes and Hennessy (1996</xref>) showed that in children improvement in object recognition was caused by a decrease in the false alarm rate, accuracy was computed using <italic>D&#8217; </italic>(D prime). <italic>D&#8217;</italic> also protects against overestimation of accuracy due to guessing (chance performance) and perseverative responses, as participants were able to obtain five correct responses by just pressing the key continuously. <italic>D&#8217;</italic> is a measure that is calculated based on signal detection theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-1" rid="c58">MacMillan &amp; Creelman, 2005</xref>). It is calculated with accuracy <italic>H</italic> corrected for false alarms <italic>F</italic> by deducting the false alarms from the hits. Hence, in the present study, the number of false alarms (new items: four distracters) was deducted from the hits (old items: five test items). As these scores have a different number of items as a basis, the probabilities of hits <italic>H</italic> and false alarms <italic>F</italic> were calculated first in percent before computing<italic> D&#8217; = H &#8211; F</italic>. Probabilities were not <italic>z</italic>-transformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr92-1" rid="c92">Shaw, 1984</xref>) to preserve information about performance levels.</p>

<title>Delay Tasks</title>

<p align="left">The delay tasks allowed participants to abort the presentation along with their response and move on to the next item. In this way, participants could potentially shorten or lengthen the delay and hence the real-time duration of the delays was computed. The correlational analysis per age group showed that the two types of delay task&#8211;size and position&#8211;were significantly correlated with each other in both of the children&#8217;s groups (6&#8211;7-year-old children: <italic>r</italic> = .70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; 8&#8211;9-year-old children: <italic>r</italic> = .51, <italic>p</italic> = .014). In adults, this was not the case, <italic>r</italic> = .19, <italic>ns</italic>. For this reason, the two delay tasks were averaged into one delay duration factor. This had the advantage that only one statistical effect instead of two similar ones was obtained. When comparing the outcome of the spatial memory analyses with one versus two delay tasks as covariates, the main statistical results for object and place memory were the same. Nevertheless, in case of significant delay effects, the impact of the size versus position delay was explored in more detail and broken down by age group. Linear regression was used to predict memory from the delay duration.</p>

<title>Accuracy</title>

<p align="left">The increase in memory accuracy in the three arrays was analyzed in a 2 (Objects/Places) by 4 (Learning/Blocks) by 3 (Array) by 3 (Age) MANCOVA with repeated measures on the first two factors and delay duration as a covariate. An overview of the statistical results is given in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-1" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. The adults showed better memory than children, <italic>F</italic>(2, 72) = 12.59, <italic>p </italic>= .001, &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> = .17, with adults remembering 63.4% on average, 8&#8211;9-year-olds 40.3%, and 6&#8211;7-year-olds 26.1%.

<p align="left">There was a main effect of delay, <italic>F</italic>(1, 72) = 12.59, <italic>p </italic>= .001, &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> = .17. Delay was significantly correlated with memory accuracy, <italic>r </italic>= .25, <italic>p</italic> = .036. However, this held only for the youngest children (6&#8211;7-year-olds: <italic>r </italic>= .70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; size delay: <italic>r</italic> = .64, <italic>p</italic> = .001; position delay: <italic>r</italic> = .67, <italic>p</italic> = .001), while correlations were approaching zero for the 8&#8211;9-year-olds, <italic>p</italic> .759, and were also non-significant in adults, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .193. In the 6&#8211;7-year-old children, memory accuracy could be predicted from the delay duration, <italic>F</italic>(2, 22) = 9.65, <italic>p</italic> = .001, <italic>R</italic> = .71, <italic>R<sup location="post">2</sup></italic> = .50. The longer they thought about the size and position of the animals during the delay, the better their general memory accuracy score thereafter. This was the only significant effect of delay duration on memory accuracy.</p>

<p align="left">Object and place memory accuracy varied per array, <italic>F</italic>(2, 72) = 4.75, <italic>p </italic>= .012, &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> = .13. Post hoc tests (two-tailed) showed that place memory was only significantly worse than object memory accuracy in the empty condition (objects: <italic>M</italic> = 47.2, places: <italic>M</italic> = 25.2), but not in the frame (objects: <italic>M</italic> = 47.9, places: <italic>M</italic> = 47.6) or the grid condition (objects: <italic>M</italic> = 47.5, places: <italic>M</italic> = 44.0). The interaction did not vary with age, <italic>F</italic>(4, 72) = .41, <italic>ns</italic>, showing that explicit boundaries resulted in improved place memory performance in both adults and children.</p>

<p align="left">A three-way interaction between object and place memory, learning, and age, <italic>F</italic>(3, 72) = 2.67, <italic>p </italic>= .016, &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> = .08, showed that the number of accurately recognized object shapes, but not their locations, increased in children (see the plotted means in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc5-1" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> ), while both object and place memory accuracy improved in adults (see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc5-2" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Post hoc tests (two-tailed) showed that, in children, the gap between object and place memory widened because of the selective improvement in object memory. Adults started at about the same level where children had ended the experiment, and also with better object than place memory. However, while the adults improved somewhat on object memory, they also continuously improved on place memory so that adults had closed this initial gap at the end of the session.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig5"/></p>

<p align="left">Improvement in object and place memory varied in the three array conditions, <italic>F</italic>(6, 72) = 2.42, <italic>p </italic>= .028, &#951;<sup location="post">2</sup> = .07 (see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc6-1" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> ).

Post hoc tests (two-tailed) showed that the complete absence of explicit boundaries on the empty screen produced a large gap between object and place memory already in the first block, with better object than place memory. This gap narrowed during the task due to some place learning, but did not close completely. In contrast, in the arrays with explicit spatial boundaries, there was no significant performance gap between object and place memory at any time during the experiment.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig6"/></p>

<title>Latencies</title>

<p align="left">Change in memory latencies with the three arrays during the experiment was analyzed in a 2 (Objects/Places) by 4 (Learning/Blocks) by 3 (Array) by 3 (Age) MANCOVA with repeated measures on the first two factors and delay duration as a covariate. Only correct responses were analyzed. An overview of the statistical effects is given in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc3-1" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>.

While latencies for object memory were similar for each array (empty: <italic>M</italic> = 871.7, frame: <italic>M</italic> = 895.1, grid: <italic>M</italic> = 858.8), place memory latencies were prolonged for the empty array (<italic>M</italic> = 944.7), as compared to the two arrays with explicit spatial boundaries (frame: <italic>M</italic> = 864.4, grid: <italic>M</italic> = 849.3).

</sec>

<sec id="s18" disp-level="subsect2">

<title>Delay Duration</title>

<p align="left">The effects of delay duration on reaction times were more numerous and specific than for memory accuracy. First, there was a main effect of delay for latencies, <italic>F</italic>(1, 72) = 18.67, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001, &#951;<sup location="post">2 </sup>= .23. Reaction times and delay duration were significantly correlated, <italic>r</italic> = .39, <italic>p</italic> = .001; the longer the participants&#8217; delay, the slower their memory reaction times. This held true for the children (6&#8211;7-year-olds: <italic>r</italic> = .57, <italic>p</italic> = .006; 8&#8211;9-year-olds: <italic>r</italic> = .63, <italic>p</italic> = .002), but not for the adults, <italic>r</italic> = .15, <italic>ns, </italic>showing consistency in the speed of perceptual judgment and recognition memory only in children.</p>

<p align="left">Second, delay duration was also important for object versus place memory reaction times, <italic>F</italic>(1, 72) = 7.27, <italic>p </italic>= .009, &#951;<sup location="post">2 </sup>= .11. Across age, object memory latencies could not be predicted by the duration of either of the two delay tasks, <italic>p</italic> .16, but place memory latencies were predicted by position delay duration, <italic>F</italic>(2, 72) = 8.34, <italic>p</italic> = .001, <italic>R</italic> = .44, <italic>R<sup location="post">2</sup></italic> = .19. When this was broken down by age, in 6&#8211;7-year-old children, both delay durations were significantly correlated with place memory latencies (size delay: <italic>r</italic> = .64, <italic>p</italic> = .001; position delay: <italic>r</italic> = .58, <italic>p</italic> = .005), but not with object memory latencies, <italic>p</italic> .18. The longer the 6&#8211;7-year-olds took in the delay tasks, the more time they needed to decide whether a place was occupied or not. This was also the case in 8&#8211;9-year-old children (size delay: <italic>r</italic> = .56, <italic>p</italic> = .006; position delay: <italic>r</italic> = .51, <italic>p</italic> = .016), but in addition there was a significant correlation between the size delay duration and object memory latencies, <italic>r</italic> = .71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The longer the 8&#8211;9-year-olds took to decide whether an animal was really large or small, the more time they needed to decide whether they had seen a shape before. This corresponded to an earlier study with another sample, in which the size delay task specifically lengthened the reaction times for object memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1" rid="c50">Lange-K&#252;ttner &amp; Friederici, 2000</xref>).

<title>Acceleration of Reactions</title>

<p align="left">Third, there were several significant interactions between learning, object and place memory, delay, and array (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc4-1" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> ). To investigate these interactions with learning, an acceleration score was computed for latencies across blocks by accumulating differences in reaction times (gains) and decelerations (losses) in the experiment for each participant.
<disp-formula id="eq1"><alternatives><graphic id="eq1a" xlink:href="sjp_72_4_197_eq1a.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
</alternatives></disp-formula>
The variable &#8220;acceleration&#8221; is the score composed of the values of the four reaction times rt<sub location="post">1</sub> to rt<sub location="post">4</sub>. The differences between a preceding reaction time rt<sub location="post">x</sub> and a subsequent reaction time rt<sub location="post">y</sub> were summed up three times (<italic>n</italic> = 3). For instance, if participants constantly accelerated, the first reaction time would be the highest and the following latencies would always be lower. Thus, when a lower latency was deducted from a preceding higher one, this resulted in a positive value (gain), for all subsequent differences, and the final score was positive. However, if constant deceleration occurred, the first reaction time would be the lowest, and the subsequent reaction times would all gradually increase. Thus, when a longer latency was deducted from a preceding shorter one, the difference value was negative and the final score was also a negative value (loss). Furthermore, fluctuations in reaction times could have resulted in a near-zero score. This acceleration variable was used in the correlations and post hoc tests.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl4"/></p>

<p align="left">There was only one two-way interaction, namely, that between learning and array, showing that reaction times accelerated differently in each array, <italic>F</italic>(6, 72) = 2.89, <italic>p </italic>= .01, &#951;<sup location="post">2 </sup>= .09.

<title>Spatial Binding in the CRT and Children&#8217;s Place Learning</title>

<p align="left">The fact that children improved on object, but not on place memory accuracy led to the question whether place versus region binding was an explanatory factor.

<title>Discussion</title>

<p align="left">The present study successfully used a maximized learning design to investigate memory improvement in children and adults in three different types of spatial conditions: an empty condition without visible spatial boundaries except for the edges of the screen, a frame condition in which the area where shapes could appear and disappear in the presentation was delimited, and a grid condition where the individual places were delimited.</p>

<p align="left">First, the mere presence of an array with explicit spatial array boundaries facilitated visual memory instantly in the first block, independent of age, in a way that the edges of the screen in the empty condition did not. It did not matter whether individual places were explicit, but it was important that the area where the shapes could appear was delimited, not unlike borders delimiting the areas of states (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Axia, Bremner, Deluca, &amp; Andreasen, 1998</xref>). Hence, area boundaries cued an <italic>external instantaneous</italic> facilitation of place memory.</p>

<p align="left">Second, during the session, both object shape and place memory gradually improved in adults, but only object memory significantly improved in children. Children who drew spatial boundaries for a common region for objects that matched each other in appearance or were in close proximity to each other showed better place memory already in the first block; however, this did not explain why place learning did not occur during the task. Hence, the common region binding appeared to be limited to an <italic>internal instantaneous</italic> conceptual facilitation of place memory.</p>

<p align="left">Thus, neither the exposure effect to spatial arrays with different amounts of explicit spatial boundaries (external stimulus structure) nor children&#8217;s spatial binding concepts (internal stimulus encoding) could explain the absence of place learning in children during the experiment. Visual discrimination, spatial memory, and delay sensitivity are currently in the focus of researchers working on spatial memory in animals, children, and Parkinson patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr78-1" rid="c78">Paule et al., 2012</xref>). The present study also contributes to this research with new findings on the significance and specificity of <italic>delay and acceleration</italic> effects in spatial learning.</p>

<title>The Empty Spatial Expanse</title>

<p align="left">Contrary to expectations, it did not really matter how detailed and small the areas were that the spatial axes delimited in the spatial arrays. Whether a grid delimited an individual place for each shape or a frame delimited the area in which the shapes appeared and disappeared did not really matter; the main factor was that spatial boundaries were present. The enormous importance of spatial boundaries for visual memory became very clear in the condition in which there were no spatial boundaries, but just an empty screen in which the same shapes appeared and disappeared at the very same places as in the other two conditions. In this empty screen condition, object memory was significantly better than place memory already in the first block in all age groups. This initial gap narrowed, but did not close completely. The empty expanse was the most difficult spatial context to remember places, with less accurate memory, slower reaction times on average, and less acceleration of reactions during the task.</p>

<p align="left">What is so difficult about an empty expanse (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Humphreys, 1999</xref>)? Swiss psychologists were able to observe people&#8217;s &#8220;shock&#8221; (prolonged reactions) when they encountered the empty spaces of the Rorschach Plates VII and IX (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-1" rid="c57">Loosli Usteri, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr96-1" rid="c96">Smith, 1997</xref>). Historically, in the first half of the last century, psychologists investigated when people thought an empty expanse was filled with particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Jaensch, 1911</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-1" rid="c70">M&#246;ller, 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr90-1" rid="c90">Schumann, 1920</xref>). In a series of early psychological experiments, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-2" rid="c25">Jaensch (1911</xref>) showed that when vertical axes were hanging from a ceiling, they functioned like optical plummets, or spatial axes, and people were more likely to notice that he had illuminated the spatial expanse with colored light.</p>

<p align="left">In the present memory task, participants could not do anything about the spatial array, but in drawing, one can actually structure an empty expanse. For instance, when children begin to structure an empty page, with age, they construct increasingly complex systems using explicit spatial axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1" rid="c41">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-3" rid="c44">2009</xref>). And indeed, the more advanced the spatial system that children were drawing, the more they regulated the size of the figures within the system. In fact, they could downsize figures so much that figures were nearly only particles within a vector system: Children who drew very small pin men were more likely to construct advanced spatial systems than children who drew large figures. These advanced spatial systems with explicit axes took over from an earlier size regulation system &#8211; which originated from the time when children were just drawing figures in empty pictorial space &#8211; where the amount and number of figures determined how large they could be in order to fit them all on one page.</p>

<p align="left">In the present memory task, the participants could not do anything about the spatial arrays or the size of the shapes, but in the place memory test, the shape that had originally occupied the location in the presentation phase had vanished in the test phase, and only a star appeared in each location. Hence, in this memory task as well, the occupiers of the places were reduced in their visual complexity and uniqueness to a <italic>uniform</italic> placeholder. The use of the original shapes for the test of the place would have transformed their function to quasi-landmarks because, by definition, landmarks must be more rich and unique in their visual information than the uniform placeholders in order to facilitate orientation. Instead, the study showed that, in the absence of unique shape information, the presence of explicit spatial boundaries was essential for the support of both children&#8217;s and adults&#8217; place memory.</p>

<title>Delay, Speed and Acceleration in Place Learning</title>

<p align="left">In addition to the test of whether explicit spatial boundaries have an impact, the experiment allowed for the precise control of reaction times and delay duration (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-2" rid="c47">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2012</xref>).</p>

<p align="left">Adults had faster reaction times than children did, and more importantly, adults&#8217; reaction times for place recognition were faster than for object recognition, while this was not the case in children. Previous research with adults using different shapes in empty space (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-2" rid="c69">Mecklinger &amp; Pfeifer, 1996</xref>), as well as similar geometrical shapes in a grid array (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-3" rid="c68">Mecklinger &amp; M&#252;ller, 1996</xref>, Experiments 2a and 2b), had also found that adults have faster reaction times for places than shapes. In addition, the slower adults were in the position delay task, the more they accelerated in the place recognition test thereafter. This suggested that adults were closely monitoring their reaction times.</p>

<p align="left">Given cognitive capacity limitations in children, one would predict that the longer the delay, the worse the memory. However, this was different in children&#8217;s memory accuracy. In 6&#8211;7-year-old children, the delay duration was predictive of accuracy insofar as the longer children took in the delay, the better their recognition memory. This suggested that children may have used the delay for thorough visual inspection because slow processors can take in more visual information (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr75-1" rid="c75">Orlian &amp; Rose, 1997</xref>). At this age, slowing down for careful visual inspection in order to achieve accuracy also occurs in drawing. For instance, the pseudo-geometrical circular forms that are drawn fast and plentiful by 5-year-olds are produced much slowly by 7-year-olds who understand the geometry of a perfect circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 1998</xref>). Delay duration did not matter anymore for the memory accuracy of the 8&#8211;9-year-old children and the adults.</p>

<p align="left">However, the more time both age groups of children took in either delay task, the slower their place memory latencies, that is, the more time they needed to decide whether a place was occupied or not. This suggested that children probably exerted more thorough visual scanning in the place than in the shape memory test, in which the delay duration had no impact.</p>

<p align="left">However, as in a previous study with another sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-2" rid="c50">Lange-K&#252;ttner &amp; Friederici, 2000</xref>), a very specific effect of the size delay task emerged in 8&#8211;9-year-old children: The longer they took in the size delay task, the longer the reaction times for object memory. In the previous study, this was evaluated as a brain system resource-based interference of the delay task on the memory task thereafter. In the dual-task paradigm of working memory theory, it was first assumed that if two processes need to share the same modality-specific memory subsystem, performance will be poorer than if one of the two processes is engaged in the other subsystem, that is, the phonological loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-1" rid="c55">Logie, 1995</xref>). For instance, engaging in tapping during presentation or delay suppresses efficient visual encoding more than articulation because of the modality specificity of the working memory subsystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr83-2" rid="c83">Pickering et al., 2001</xref>). Likewise, neuroconstructivists assume that activated brain areas in children become increasingly smaller and responsive toward more specific stimuli, in short, more &#8220;modular&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Karmiloff-Smith, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr60-1" rid="c60">Mareschal et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, if the size delay task and the object memory task were both drawing on the &#8220;what system,&#8221; this size delay task should produce more interference than the position delay task&#8211;which instead would have drawn on resources from the &#8220;where system.&#8221; Thus, while place memory latencies showed no specific interference by just one of the delay tasks, object memory latencies did.</p>

<p align="left">This suggested that 8&#8211;9-year-old children had developed a specific memory system for shapes &#8211; which is positively correlated with IQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Hayes &amp; Conway, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Hayes &amp; Taplin, 1993</xref>). Object memory acceleration was found to be independent of age, while place memory acceleration score was not, which also indicated a more autonomic shape memory.</p>

<p align="left">However, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr100-2" rid="c100">Treisman (2006</xref>) suggested that &#8220;object files&#8221; bind features from both the &#8220;what&#8221; and the &#8220;where&#8221; systems, and <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr85-1" rid="c85">Postle and D&#8217;Esposito (1999</xref>) confirmed that object and place memory information is synchronized in the frontal lobes (but separate for perception in the posterior brain). When children&#8217;s spatial binding was considered in the statistical analysis, a highly interesting result for object latencies emerged. In the empty screen condition, children who conceptualized common region in the CRT slowed down when remembering shapes and maintained the level of object memory accuracy (reaction time-accuracy trade-off), while they allowed place memory accuracy to go down to floor level. This result showed that these children clearly prioritized object over place memory.</p>

<p align="left">Nevertheless, when the frame created a common region for the appearance and disappearance of the shapes in the display, and this matched children&#8217;s drawing of common region in the CRT, a relatively excellent place memory emerged from the beginning of the experiment, while object memory gradually caught up. Hence, children&#8217;s binding of objects into common regions according to similarity and proximity made their memory performance more systematic and specific to the spatial array.</p>

<p align="left">However, children who showed object-place binding instead allowed place memory to deteriorate in the frame &#8211; although it recovered in the last block &#8211; while object memory continuously improved. The memory performance of children who conceptualized object-place binding could fluctuate and recover in relatively unpredictable ways. A match between the denotation of single places in the grid and object-place binding in the CRT did not facilitate memory in any systematic way. This was probably the case because object-place binding produces more units and may lead to a piecemeal approach.</p>

<title>Do Shapes Prevent Place Learning?</title>

<p align="left">The Association-Dissociation-Association (ADA) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-3" rid="c43">Lange-K&#252;ttner, 2008c</xref>) suggests that, in young children with limited information processing speed, objects&#8217; shapes may enter the information processing system along with their places, but only shapes can be retrieved successfully because of their better visual discriminability. According to this model, shape information has priority over place information.</p>

<p align="left">Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-2" rid="c8">Cohen et al. (2011</xref>) showed that attempting to track the identities of multiple objects moving to different places on a screen can decrease an observer&#8217;s ability to track the objects&#8217; locations. In another paradigm, Doeller and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Doeller &amp; Burgess, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Doeller, King, &amp; Burgess, 2008</xref>) suggested that spatial learning of feature-rich landmarks in virtual reality displays is associative and sensitive to frequency, while the learning of boundaries is not. Landmark object shapes could be reinforced with contingency learning and thus blocked, overshadowed, or made irrelevant. Likewise, memory for multiple shapes required increased brain activation in order to prevent proactive interference from previously learned items (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr84-1" rid="c84">Postle, Berger, Goldstein, Curtis, &amp; D&#8217;Esposito, 2001</xref>) that children learn to control in middle childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Kail, 2002</xref>).</p>

<p align="left">From this perspective, it would not be surprising if children in the present experiment especially cared about object memory improvement and consolidation. Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc5-3" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows that when the first two experimental blocks were repeated, this was a watershed: Children particularly focused on object memory in the two subsequently repeated blocks. In contrast, adults showed a continuously increasing place memory, but allowed object memory to drop to the starting level. All participants experienced only one shape at a time in the test and hence could not make a direct comparison between shapes. Thus, a very good memory representation was needed for the decision about what was target and what was distractor. In adults, even with the faster paced task, object memory was probably at a level that was acceptable to participants so they would allow themselves to improve selectively in place memory. However, adults also initially improved in object memory without closing the gap with place memory (see Blocks 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc5-4" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> in which object memory is still significantly better than place memory). But place memory appeared to have benefited more thereafter because of a temporary proactive interference of shapes caused by the repetition of the items of the memory set of Block 1 (red) in Block 3 (red2).</p>

<p align="left">The results of a follow-up experiment with a variant of this task are currently being analyzed and suggest that shapes are indeed more prone to proactive interference than places. This may be the case because, ideally, the places could be mentally arranged in an array &#8211; and this would be easier if the array was obvious and explicit. The distribution of locations could then become simultaneously scrutinized in the mind even if the placeholders appeared sequentially. In contrast, the sequential appearance of objects in the same place would create overlapping schemata of figures in mental imagery. This may appear to be a remote possibility, but young children do draw overlapping objects separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-1" rid="c49">Lange-K&#252;ttner &amp; Ebersbach, 2013</xref>).</p>

<p align="left">Children may have gated their selective attention toward the object memory task because it may have seemed &#8220;harder&#8221; and thus in need of increased attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-1" rid="c59">Mangun &amp; Fannon, 2007</xref>): The frequent visiting of several objects in one place in the object memory test would have required constant repeated associations and dissociations, that is, object-place association, dissociation of this object from this place, association of a new object with this place, and so on. In contrast, the placeholder left the object-place links between the original shape and its place intact in the place test. Object memory may thus have absorbed more information processing capacity.</p>

</sec>

<sec id="s28" disp-level="subsect1">

<title>Does Speed Help Place Learning?</title>

<p align="left">The second assumption of the ADA model was that young children&#8217;s information processing needed to be faster so that places could be retrieved from memory in addition to the shapes. Indeed, the adults had faster reaction times for place memory than for object memory, while the children did not. Nevertheless, in both age groups, children&#8217;s reaction times for place memory became faster during the experiment&#8211;and in absolute terms they accelerated more than adults did. Although in proportion to their slower baseline this cannot be taken as children being speedier than adults, there was no difference in object memory acceleration, and the great acceleration spoke to children&#8217;s effort in the place memory task.</p>

<p align="left">Children at this age have more difficulty with negative than with positive feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Crone, Jennigs, &amp; Van der Molen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">Lange-K&#252;ttner, Averbeck, Hirsch, Wie&#223;ner, &amp; Lamba, 2012</xref>) and they slow down after having made a mistake while only autistic children accelerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr98-1" rid="c98">Sokhadze et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr103-1" rid="c103">Vlamings, Jonkman, Hoeksma, van Engeland, &amp; Kemner, 2008</xref>). Hence, the acceleration of place memory latencies may not have been linked to accuracy yet since this was not yet a priority for these children.</p>

<sec id="s29" disp-level="subsect1">

<title>Concepts and Learning</title>

<p align="left">In short, Piaget&#8217;s assumption that objects can be conceptualized as just points in mathematical space &#8211; object-region binding consisted of the allocation of a common region to matching <italic>dots</italic> &#8211; was confirmed as a conceptual factor that facilitated place memory instantaneously, and importantly, also promoted systematic learning. Still, in the absence of landmarks, both children and adults relied on spatial boundaries as cues. This showed that, once explicit information on the spatial distribution of places was available, this information could be used at all ages.</p>

<p align="left">Furthermore, the present study went some way to uphold <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-2" rid="c79">Piaget&#8217;s (1969</xref>) assumption that children need to relegate figurative thinking to an illustrative factor rather than evaluate their perception as an indispensable source of knowledge. Indeed, the fact that place memory learning did not occur in children during the spatial task appears to have been due to a figurative bias, that is, selective attention to shapes in order to prevent proactive shape interference. In Piaget&#8217;s words the decision for selective attention to either shape or location could be described as follows (with facts/events being the individual shapes):</p>

<p align="left">But it requires experience to decide which of the possible frameworks is the appropriate one ... because the individual facts of experience will be resistant ... . This resistance will be greater if the fact ... forms part of the general flux of events, or if it is a chance event: These limitations illustrate the characteristic individual and irreversible originality of each particular event and considerably reinforce the obstacles to the integral deducibility of experience.

<p align="left">The three arrays. The memory sets in Figure 2 were presented in the same way in three different spatial arrays, but the amount of explicit array boundaries varied. There were no visible boundaries in the empty screen (A). There was an outline of the area where shapes could appear and disappear in the frame condition (B). Each individual place was delimited with a spatial boundary in the grid (C). Children and adults saw only one type of array, respectively, to prevent priming effects.</p>

<p align="left">The timeline. The first row represents the timeline for an object shape test with an object delay, the second row for an object location test with a position delay. Delay tasks were counterbalanced for the two types of memory tests. The third row gives the timing in milliseconds for each component of a block. Stimuli in this timeline are illustrations and do not correspond to the exact standardized size in the experiment. There was always a pause of 3 s between an instruction and the next screen. There was a pause of 3 s after each response in the delay. There was a pause of 1 s after each response in the test. The last screen marked the end of the block with a wait key to allow children a short break if needed.</p>

In order to counterbalance delay type, each memory set was tested four times: twice for the object shape and twice for the object location. Results were then averaged for object and place memory, respectively, per memory set.</p>
