<p align="left">Racial classification has drawn increasing attention in public discourse; it intertwines with issues related to racialized perceptions. However, few social psychological studies have systematically examined racial categorization processes and their implications for interracial relations. In 5 studies, we investigated the role of racial essentialism in influencing several important psychological aspects of racial categorization. Results linked the belief in racial essentialism to an increased tendency to engage in race-based categorization (Studies 1&#8211;3) and greater sensitivity in discerning racial group membership (Studies 4&#8211;5).

<p align="left">In the United States, racial discourses tend to intertwine with issues surrounding racial classification. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Brunsma (2005)</xref> noted that &#8220;[racial] classification schemes (e.g., The Great Chain of Being, the Linnaean system, the norm of Hypodescent, the U.S. Census, etc.) have attempted to divide and conquer diversity and difference in the social structure while preserving White privilege&#8221; (p. 1132). Throughout most of the 20th century, Americans were expected to adhere to the one-drop rule and designate themselves as members of one and only one racial group in the U.S. Census. Some scholars posited that the principle of <italic>hypodescent</italic>, which assigns multiracial individuals to the subordinate racial category, serves to reinforce White dominance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1" rid="c41">Hickman, 1997</xref>). With the rapid increase in racial diversity and intergroup marriages, issues of racial classification have drawn increasing attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr73-1" rid="c73">Saulny, 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, until recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1" rid="c44">Ho, Sidanius, Levin, &amp; Banaji, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-1" rid="c69">Peery &amp; Bodenhausen, 2008</xref>), few social psychological studies have systematically examined racial categorization processes from social perceivers' perspective.</p>
<p align="left">Drawing from research on lay theories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Chiu, Hong, &amp; Dweck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Dweck, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1" rid="c47">Hong, Chiu, Dweck, Lin, &amp; Wan, 1999</xref>) and psychological essentialism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-1" rid="c64">Medin &amp; Ortony, 1989</xref>), we examined the social cognitive factors that influence perceivers' racial classification practices in the current investigation. Essentialist theory of race is a belief that race is a real entity that consists of underlying essence, determining a person's dispositions, and is characterized by clear, unalterable physical and psychological markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-1" rid="c67">No et al., 2008</xref>). Research on essentialist theory has revealed many important intergroup consequences of this lay belief (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-1" rid="c52">Jayaratne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1" rid="c54">Keller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr83-1" rid="c83">Williams &amp; Eberhardt, 2008</xref>); however, the relationship between racial essentialism and racial categorization practices has remained unexplored. The currrent research aims to fill this void.</p>
<p align="left">In this research, we tested the hypothesis that holding an essentialist theory of race is positively associated with the proclivity to engage in racial classification and sensitivity in discerning racial categories. In the following sections, we elaborate our hypotheses by reviewing the historical context of racial classification in the United States, the existing literature on lay theories, and their attendant categorization processes. Next, we report five studies in which we tested our hypotheses. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for understanding interracial relations.</p>

<title>Racial Classification in the United States</title>
<p align="left">The question of how descendants of mixed racial ancestry should be categorized has a prominent history in the United States. The principle of <italic>hypodescent</italic> assigns children with parents from different racial groups to the group that is socially subordinate. An extreme form of the hypodescent principle is the <italic>one-drop rule</italic>, which states that individuals with any non-White ancestry are classified as members of the non-White race.</p>
<p align="left">The principle of hypodescent evolved as slavery was established. The principle protected the property interests of slave owners, dictating that children of a slave woman and her owner or other White men would grow up as slaves, adding to the property of the owners of the women (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Hollinger, 2003</xref>). Paradoxically, the principle received the strongest legal definitions long after the end of slavery in the early 20th century. By early 1940s, 30 U.S. states had antimiscegenation laws that prohibit ethnoracial mixing. Although the Supreme Court ruled in the case of <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-1" rid="c59"><italic>Loving vs. Virginia</italic> (1967)</xref> that the Virginia antimiscegenation statute was unconstitutional, practices that support monoracial classification continued. For instance, throughout most of the 20th century, all respondents were expected to be classified as members of a single racial group in the U.S. Census. It was not until Census 2000 that multiracial Americans started to have the option of selecting one or more racial categories to indicate their racial identities.</p>
<p align="left">Although antimiscegenation laws and institutionalized practices of the one-drop rule have become history, the principle of hypodescent continues to influence Americans' racial categorization. A longitudinal study revealed that most parents of biracial children continued to follow norms of hypodescent and designate their children as members of a monoracial minority instead of classifying their children as &#8220;multiracial&#8221; and &#8220;White,&#8221; although this trend seems to be weakening (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-2" rid="c5">Brunsma, 2005</xref>). Another study on racial categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-2" rid="c69">Peery &amp; Bodenhausen, 2008</xref>) further demonstrated that Americans spontaneously classify racially ambiguous faces (50%:50% morphing of Black and White source faces) as &#8220;Black&#8221; or &#8220;not White&#8221; if the targets were known to have one Black parent or live in a racially mixed neighborhood. A recent study on hypodescent and racial hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-2" rid="c44">Ho et al., 2011</xref>) also showed that Americans required a morphed Black&#8211;White face to have a smaller proportion of Black for it to be perceived as Black, but required a larger proportion of White for it to be considered as White.</p>
<p align="left">Racial categorization has become a public issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Brunsma, 2006</xref>) that has significant social implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1" rid="c50">Horry &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>). In a recent field experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-1" rid="c68">Pager, Western, and Bonikowski (2009)</xref> had individuals of different racial backgrounds (Black, White, and Latino) with the same fictitious resumes applied for low-wage, entry-level jobs throughout New York City. The individuals were matched on verbal abilities, physical attractiveness, and interactional styles. They were also trained to act and dress in a similar manner during job interviews. Nonetheless, White applicants received callbacks and job offers more often than their Black or Latino counterparts. Furthermore, employers responded similarly toward White applicants who were just released from prison and Black or Latino applicants with clean backgrounds. These findings revealed that racial group membership has significant impact on how individuals are perceived and evaluated. What is the relationship between racial categorization practices and racial essentialism? How might essentialist theory of race guide racial categorization? We turn to these questions next.</p>

<title>The Role of Lay Racial Essentialism</title>
<p align="left">People formulate theories to make sense of their environments, much like scientists do (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Heider, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-1" rid="c55">Kelly, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-2" rid="c64">Medin &amp; Ortony, 1989</xref>). Although lay theories are not necessarily well articulated, they have been shown to guide behavior, providing coherent systems of beliefs to help individuals organize their understanding of the social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">Chiu, Dweck, Tong, &amp; Fu, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1" rid="c46">Hong, Benet-Martinez, Chiu, &amp; Morris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-1" rid="c49">Hong, Levy, &amp; Chiu, 2001</xref>). Importantly, research has shown that perceivers tend to formulate theories about core essence underlying observed physical differences across groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Gelman &amp; Hirschfeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Haslam, Rothschild, &amp; Ernst, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">2002</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Gil-White, 2001</xref>, for similar arguments for ethnic groups; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-1" rid="c70">Prentice &amp; Miller, 2006</xref>, for gender groups). <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr85-1" rid="c85">Yzerbyt, Corneille, and Estrada (2001)</xref> have differentiated two aspects of group perceptions: essentialism and entitativity. <italic>Essentialism</italic> refers to the perceived inferential power of a given group membership, whereas <italic>entitativity</italic> refers to the perceived similarity of trait-based or goal-based attributes possessed by social targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">Ip, Chiu, &amp; Wan, 2006</xref>). Essentialism and entitativity are closely related and are mutually reinforcing (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr85-2" rid="c85">Yzerbyt et al., 2001</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr71-1" rid="c71">Rothbart and Taylor (1992)</xref>, the imputation of an &#8220;essence&#8221; rests on whether a particular social category is believed to possess <italic>inductive potential</italic> and <italic>inalterability</italic>. Inductive potential refers to whether group membership is telling of individual members' characteristics (e.g., traits, abilities, and behaviors), whereas inalterability refers to whether group membership is fixed for a relatively long duration. Essentialism, hence, helps structure individuals' understanding of the social world by organizing groups into meaningful categories with distinct attributes.</p>
<p align="left">Given that race is a highly salient aspect of social understanding in the U.S. society (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Deaux, 2006</xref>), individuals may have attributed different meanings to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Appiah, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">Hirschfeld, 1997</xref>). Some lay people infer &#8220;essence&#8221; from racial groups, believing in <italic>lay racial essentialism</italic>: They conceptualize race as a fundamental and meaningful source of human division that has an inherent, inalterable biological basis, and is characterized by clear physical markers that are indicative of one's abilities and traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Chao, Chen, Roisman, &amp; Hong, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-2" rid="c67">No et al., 2008</xref>). Although some individuals subscribe to lay racial essentialism, others see race as an arbitrary category that does not possess inherent essence; rather, they perceive race as a social construction that is used to differentiate social groups in order to maintain existing social hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Fairchild, Yee, Wyatt, &amp; Weizmann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr77-1" rid="c77">Smedley &amp; Smedley, 2005</xref>). In line with this latter perspective, the concept of race has been discredited by some anthropologists and geneticists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Hirschfeld, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-1" rid="c79">Templeton, 1998</xref>). The purpose of the current research was not to examine whether there is inherent biological basis underlying racial categories but to investigate how racial essentialism as a lay theory affects the categorization practices of the perceivers.</p>
<p align="left">Our major premise is that racial essentialism orients lay people to see race as a meaningful category that helps them to understand their social world. It affords inferences of unalterable, unambiguous, and discrete dispositions to members of a racial group. Therefore, relative to those who endorse racial essentialism less, individuals who endorse racial essentialism more strongly (a) would categorize people along racial lines more readily and (b) would be more sensitive and stringent in discerning subtle differences in phenotypic racial characteristics. We delineate each of these processes in the next sections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4">
<title>Race-Based Categorization</title>
<p align="left">Lay theories color how individuals make sense of their social environment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-2" rid="c12">Chiu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-2" rid="c47">Hong et al., 1999</xref>). They affect categorization by increasing the perceived relevance or usefulness of a certain criterion or dimension as the basis of categorization in a given judgment context (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-1" rid="c63">Medin, 1989</xref>). By construing race as a meaningful entity with inferential potential, racial essentialism heightens the relevance of race in making social judgment. Thus, we posit that individuals who endorse racial essentialism more strongly would be more inclined to categorize on the basis of race compared with those who endorse racial essentialism less.</p>
<p align="left">To elaborate, the same stimulus can be categorized in different ways depending on what criterion is used as the basis for categorization. For instance, India can be classified as an Asian nation if geographical location is the basis of categorization, or a developing country if the stage of economic development is the basis of categorization. Likewise, in a triad categorization task (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1" rid="c53">Ji, Zhang, &amp; Nisbett, 2004</xref>), which requires participants to classify three objects (e.g., panda, banana, and monkey) into two categories, participants may classify differently depending on which classification dimension seems most relevant in making their judgment (e.g., panda and monkey belong to one category because they are both animals; monkey and banana belong to one category because they are thematically related: monkey eats banana).</p>
<p align="left">Lay theories about the malleability of human attributes guide the categorization of social information (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">Gelman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-3" rid="c64">Medin &amp; Ortony, 1989</xref>). People who believe a certain valued attribute to be fixed perceive that attribute to be an informative judgment dimension because it allows them to make inferences on the basis of observed characteristics. Therefore, they prefer to use the fixed attribute or its external manifestations as the basis of categorization. For instance, in the domain of academic achievement, individuals who believe in fixed intelligence tend to categorize others on the basis of their test scores (overt expressions of intelligence; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">Hong, Chiu, Dwecks, &amp; Sacks, 1997</xref>). Similarly, in the domain of personality, believers of fixed personality tend to categorize others on the basis of their trait-relevant behaviors (overt expressions of personality traits; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr80-1" rid="c80">Tong &amp; Chiu, 2002</xref>). Given that an essentialist theory of race holds that racial categories possess fixed and immutable qualities, it renders race an important judgment dimension. Accordingly, we theorize that individuals who believe in unalterable racial essence more strongly would categorize on the basis of race more readily compared with those who endorse essentialist beliefs less. More importantly, similar to other lay theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-2" rid="c49">Hong et al., 2001</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Dweck, Hong, &amp; Chiu, 1993</xref>), the effects of essentialist theory would be domain specific. By highlighting race as a salient judgment dimension, we expect racial essentialism to influence categorization in the racial domain, but not associated with nonracial categorical judgment. In short, we hypothesize that individuals who endorse racial essentialism more strongly would tend to engage in race-based categorization relative to those who endorse racial essentialism less; however, their categorization tendency would not differ when making nonracial judgment (Hypothesis 1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5">
<title>Sensitivity to Phenotypic Traits</title>
<p align="left">Observable racial attributes, such as skin tone and facial features, are important cues that influence racial identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">AhnAllen, Suyemoto, &amp; Carter, 2006</xref>). As mentioned, individuals who believe certain attributes to be fixed tend to use the fixed attribute or its external manifestations as the basis of categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-2" rid="c48">Hong et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr80-2" rid="c80">Tong &amp; Chiu, 2002</xref>); hence, we posit that phenotypic racial characteristics would be an important basis of categorization for individuals who subscribe to racial essentialist beliefs. Specifically, given that they tend to perceive a racial group as a homogenous category, whose members share distinct physical and psychological traits that are immutable, individuals who believe in racial essentialism more strongly would be more inclined to sort people into discrete categories on the basis of such phenotypic racial characteristics as skin color and develop a greater expertise in racial categorization. Thus, stronger endorsement of racial essentialism would be associated with greater perceptual acuity in discerning minute variations in phenotypic racial characteristics, requiring clearer phenotypic evidence for racial group membership inclusion. That is, they tend to be exclusive in defining racial group membership and only consider individuals with clear phenotypic traits as members of a given racial category.</p>
<p align="left">Previous research has shown that the motivation to avoid false inclusion of outgroup members into the ingroup may motivate perceivers to set a higher threshold for ingroup membership (akin to the ingroup overexclusion effect; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-1" rid="c57">Leyens &amp; Yzerbyt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr86-1" rid="c86">Yzerbyt, Leyens, &amp; Bellour, 1995</xref>). However, we posit that the mere preference for race-based categorization would set up a perceptual set that orients essentialist theorists to be more sensitive to subtle variations in phenotypic racial traits and to require clearer phenotypic evidence before classifying an individual to a certain racial category regardless of the ingroup&#8211;outgroup status of the target. Therefore, the categorization practices associated with racial essentialism would manifest similarly when classifying people into racial ingroup, as well as into a racial outgroup.</p>
<p align="left">To elaborate, when making judgments about the racial group membership of biracial targets, because the question of &#8220;who is White&#8221; has traditionally been the focal topic of discussion in the racial classification discourse in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr84-1" rid="c84">Yancey, 2003</xref>), we expected that essentialist theorists tend to adhere to the hypodescent norms by default, demonstrating greater sensitivity in detecting subtle racial features and include only those targets with clear phenotypic features into the &#8220;White&#8221; racial category. That is, when the categorization process requires identification of White group membership, racial essentialists would be more sensitive to phenotypic Whiteness and admit only those with unambiguous phenotypic markers to the racial category. Although adherence to the hypodescent norms has traditionally been seen as a manifestation of the motivation to reinforce White dominance by overexcluding biracial individuals to the subordinate racial category (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-2" rid="c41">Hickman, 1997</xref>), we argue that the apparent adherence to the hypodescent norms among essentialist theorists might not necessarily be motivated by the desire to maintain White dominance. Rather, it can be a cognitive outcome of their greater preference for race-based categorization, which sensitizes them to subtle variations in phenotypic racial traits in general. Therefore, when the question shifts from the default of &#8220;who is White&#8221; to &#8220;who is Black,&#8221; requiring the identification of Black group membership, racial essentialists would also be sensitive to subtle phenotypic variations in Blackness and admit only those with unambiguous phenotypic markers to the racial group. In short, we hypothesize that racial essentialism is associated with a heightened sensitivity to phenotypic racial differences and adoption of more stringent classification criteria in racial categorization, regardless of the racial group membership of the perceivers and the perceived (Hypothesis 2).</p>
<p align="left">To summarize, we posit that compared with individuals who believe less strongly in racial essentialism, those who endorse this belief more strongly tend to categorize people along racial lines more readily (Hypothesis 1). They would be more sensitive to subtle phenotypic variations and adopt more stringent phenotypic criteria in racial categorization (Hypothesis 2).</p>

<sec id="s6">
<title>The Role of Racial Group Membership</title>
<p align="left">It is theoretically interesting to investigate whether these basic categorization processes only hold for the racial majority group (e.g., White in the United States) or whether they are generalizable to racial minority groups (e.g., Asian and Black in the United States). Research has shown that majority group members tend to uphold ideologies that legitimize their dominant status (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr82-1" rid="c82">Verkuyten, 2003</xref>) and endorse practices that help avoid false inclusion of outgroup members into their ingroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Castano, Yzerbyt, Bourguigon, &amp; Seron, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-2" rid="c57">Leyens &amp; Yzerbyt, 1992</xref>). Accordingly, racial essentalism might be a status legitimization ideology that supports racial categorization practices to ensure ingroup dominance and membership purity. This ingroup overexclusion perspective suggests that the hypothesized racial categorization effects would only hold among majority members, but not among minority group members.</p>
<p align="left">The lay theory perspective, however, suggests that beliefs and assumptions about the social world bias preferences in categorization practices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-3" rid="c12">Chiu, Dweck, et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-2" rid="c23">Dweck, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-3" rid="c47">Hong et al., 1999</xref>). Accordingly, an essentialist theory of race induces a preference for its associated racial classification practices. Racial essentialism would, thus, have similar effects on their endorsers among both majority and minority group members, regardless of their ingroup&#8211;outgroup membership.</p>
<p align="left">To investigate these two alternative perspectives and to examine the generalizability of the hypothesized racial categorization processes among racial majority and minority group members, we tested our hypotheses among White, Asian, and Black Americans. By examining the racial categorization processes among Asian and Black Americans, it unveils whether the hypothesized effects of racial essentialism are due to the motivation to maintain ingroup dominance and membership purity&#8212;the ingroup overexclusion perspective, or are resulted from biased preferences in categorization practices&#8212;the lay theory perspective. Consistent with the lay theory perspective, we contend that beliefs in racial essentialism bias the categorization preferences of the perceivers, shaping their racial classification practices and their racial perceptions regardless of their racial group membership. In short, we expect that the hypothesized effects of racial essentialism on racial categorization to hold across racial majority and minority groups.</p>

<title>Overview of Studies</title>
<p align="left">We tested our hypotheses in five studies. In Studies 1&#8211;3, we tested Hypothesis 1. Specifically, we experimentally manipulated participants' racial essentialism belief in Study 1 to examine the causal relationship between racial essentialism and racial categorization. In Studies 2 and 3, we further tested the link between racial essentialism and individuals' categorization tendency in racial and nonracial domains using a triad categorization task (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-2" rid="c53">Ji et al., 2004</xref>) and an implicit category learning task (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-1" rid="c62">Markman, Baldwin, &amp; Maddox, 2005</xref>), respectively. To test Hypothesis 2, in Studies 4 and 5, we assessed participants' sensitivity to phenotypic features in racial categorization using the method of constant stimuli and method of difference in psychophysics respectively, and tested its association with racial essentialism.</p>

<title>Study 1: Race-Based Categorization</title>
<p align="left">In the current study, we sought to establish the causal relationship between racial essentialism and racial categorization by manipulating racial essentialism. We adopted a triad categorization task (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-3" rid="c53">Ji et al., 2004</xref>) to measure individuals' categorization tendency in racial and nonracial domains. We hypothesize that participants in the high-racial essentialism condition would be more likely to make race-based categorization than participants in the low-racial essentialism condition. However, racial essentialism would not have an effect on categorization in nonracial domains (Hypothesis 1).</p>

<title>Racial essentialism manipulation</title>
<p align="left">We adopted the two mock articles used in <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-3" rid="c67">No et al. (2008)</xref> and in Tadmor, Chao, Hong, and Polzer (in press) to manipulate the beliefs in racial essentialism. As in these previous studies, participants were randomly assigned into one of the two manipulation conditions: the essentialism versus nonessentialism conditions. In each condition, participants were asked to read an article that described fictitious scientific research supporting either racial essentialist or nonessentialist beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-4" rid="c67">No et al., 2008</xref>). For example, the essentialism article states, &#8220;There is essence underlying racial groups. The concept of race has divided humankind into meaningful social groups based on differences in their innate qualities&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-5" rid="c67">No et al., 2008</xref>, p. 995). The nonesssentialism article refuted racial essentialism and states that &#8220;The meaning of race is socially constructed. It is used to characterize different social groups&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-6" rid="c67">No et al., 2008</xref>, p. 995). These articles were allegedly selected randomly from a collection of <italic>Time</italic> magazine. The participants were asked to read the articles as part of a reading comprehension study. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-7" rid="c67">No et al. (2008)</xref> established the effectiveness of these articles in manipulating racial essentialism or nonessentialism mindsets&#8212;they reported that after reading the essentialist article, participants endorsed racial essentialism beliefs more strongly than did participants who read the nonessentialist article. Likewise, Tadmor et al. (in press) have also found this effect. In addition, Tadmor et al. (in press, Study 1) have included a no-prime control condition in which participants read a scientific article about the properties of water. Participants in the no-prime control condition showed similar response patterns as those in the nonessentialism condition.</p>
<p align="left">In the current study, after reading the article, as part of the reading comprehension study, participants were asked to summarize the article and to rate how difficult it was to understand the article (from 1 = <italic>Not at all</italic> to 7 = <italic>Extremely</italic>), and how they felt about the tone of the article (from 1 = <italic>Extremely pessimistic</italic> to 7 = <italic>Extremely optimistic</italic>). The tone of the essentialism article was rated as relatively more pessimistic than that of the non-ssentialism article (&#946; = &#8722;.60), <italic>t</italic>(54) = &#8722;5.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, but the articles did not differ in the level of difficulty in comprehension (&#946; = .07), <italic>t</italic>(54) = 0.53, <italic>ns</italic>.

<title>Triad categorization task</title>
<p align="left">We used a modified version of the triad categorization task (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-4" rid="c53">Ji et al., 2004</xref>) to measure the tendency to categorize people on the basis of race. In the original triad categorization task, participants were presented with three target objects (e.g., panda, banana, and monkey) in each trial and asked to decide which two were the most closely related. The three objects in each trial can be grouped taxonomically (e.g., panda and monkey) or thematically (i.e., based on their functional relations; e.g., banana and monkey). In the current study, we created seven new trials to examine the tendency to categorize people on the basis of race. For example, the three targets in one of the new trials were Michael Jordan; Denzel Washington; Bruce Willis. Participants who categorized on the basis of race would categorize Jordan and Washington together (because they are both Black and Willis is White), whereas others would categorize Washington and Willis together (because they are both actors and Jordan is a basketball player). To assess the tendency to display race-based categorization, we counted the number of times (zero to seven) the participants categorized the targets by race across the seven trials. For comparison purpose, we also included seven trials from the original triad categorization task that were nonrace related (e.g., panda, banana, and monkey; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-5" rid="c53">Ji et al., 2004</xref>). The frequency of making taxonomy-based grouping (zero to seven) was also measured. In addition, 12 filler trials from the original task were included (e.g., green, red, and blue; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-6" rid="c53">Ji et al., 2004</xref>).

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p align="left">We hypothesize that compared with the nonessentialism article, the essentialism article would create a stronger tendency to make race-based categorization, but have no effect on the tendency to make taxonomic (vs. thematic) categorization. To test this hypothesis, we regressed categorization count on condition (&#8722;1 = nonessentialism, 1 = essentialism), categorization type (&#8722;1 = taxonomy-based, 1 = race-based), and their interaction, while controlling for the effect of article tone (mean-centered).

<p align="left">We used the modified triad categorization task in Study 1 to measure race-based and nonrace-based categorization tendency.

As in <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-3" rid="c9">Chao et al.

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p align="left">We hypothesize that racial essentialism would be positively correlated with the tendency to categorize on the basis of race, but unrelated to the tendency to make taxonomic (vs. thematic) categorization. To test this hypothesis, we regressed categorization count on racial essentialism (mean-centered), participant race (&#8722;1 = Asian, 1 = White), categorization type (&#8722;1 = taxonomy-based, 1 = race-based), as well as the interaction of racial essentialism with participant race and that with categorization type.

Specifically, the more strongly individuals endorsed racial essentialism, the more likely they were to engage in race-based categorization in the triad categorization task.

<title>Study 3: Efficiency in Learning Race-Based Categories</title>
<p align="left">In Studies 1 and 2, we found that racial essentialism is associated with a greater tendency to engage in race-based categorization but not to nonrace-based categorization. In the current study, we sought further evidence for this pattern of results using a process measure of the propensity to engage in race-based categorization. Instead of measuring the likelihood of engaging in race-based categorization, we measured sensitivity to race-based categories in a category learning task. To rule out the alternative explanation that high- (vs. low-) race essentialists are simply more skilled in categorical learning in general, we included a test of efficiency in acquiring spatial categories. We hypothesize that for both White and Asian Americans, racial essentialism would be positively associated with efficiency in learning race-based categories only but not in acquiring spatial categories.</p>

<title>Creation of experimental stimuli</title>
<p align="left">The experimental stimuli used in the racial categorization tasks in Studies 3&#8211;5 were sampled from 300 morphed faces we created to test the relationship between racial essentialism and various aspects of race-based categorization. Because a recurrent theme in the racial discourse in the United States focuses on the Black&#8211;White dichotomy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr75-1" rid="c75">Sears, Sidanius, &amp; Bobo, 2000</xref>), we used Black and White faces to examine the racial categorization processes in this and the subsequent studies. To create the stimuli, we collected 90 head and shoulder portraits of students from old college yearbooks and asked 78 undergraduate students who did not participate in any of the main studies to identify the racial identity (White, Black, Asian, Latino, or &#8220;other&#8221;) of the person in each photo. We selected the photos of 30 Blacks and 30 Whites, who were consistently identified as Blacks and Whites, respectively, by more than 90% of the participants.</p>
<p align="left">Next, we paired each original Black face with an original White face. For each pair we created a morph continuum between the original Black and White faces. The full range of morph levels and White:Black morph proportion was Level 1 (0%:100%), Level 2 (11%:89%), Level 3 (22%:78%), Level 4 (33%:67%), Level 5 (44%:56%), Level 6 (56%:44%), Level 7 (67%:33%), Level 8 (78%:22%), Level 9 (89%:11%), and Level 10 (100%:0%). For brevity, we refer to each morph level by &#8220;k% White&#8221; and henceforth implicitly designate an expression that is also (100&#8722;k)% Black. <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-1" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> presents 10 pictures created by morphing the pictures of a Black face (0% White) and a White face (100% White) at the 10-morph levels.

Each group consisted of 60 faces. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc2-1" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the faces in Group A had a mean morph level of 4.50 (between 33% and 44% White) and standard deviation of 1.00. The faces in Group B had a mean morph level of 6.50 (between 56% and 67% White) and standard deviation of 1.00.

<title>Spatial category learning task</title>
<p align="left">The implicit category learning task (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-5" rid="c62">Markman et al., 2005</xref>) was originally designed to measure efficiency in learning spatial categories. For half the participants, instead of the racial category learning task, they performed the spatial category learning task. In the spatial category learning task, each stimulus was a single dot displayed on the computer screen. Each dot appeared at one of the 10 vertical positions on the computer display, although the horizontal coordinate of the dots was fixed. The distribution of the dots along the vertical dimension was identical to the distribution used in the racial category learning task (see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc2-2" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As in the racial category learning task, participants were seated in front of a computer in separate cubicles and learned that they would perform a categorization task. There were 120 trials.

<title>Dependent measures</title>
<p align="left">Given that the participants had no prior knowledge of how the two groups differed in both the racial and the spatial category learning tasks, they learned the distributions of Group A and Group B from the feedback received after each trial. An indicator of their efficiency in category learning was their accuracy in learning the categorization rules. This was measured in the current study by applying the signal detection theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Galanter, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-1" rid="c61">Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 1991</xref>) to estimate participants' sensitivity to group differences: <italic>d</italic> prime (<italic>d</italic>&#8242;), where <italic>d</italic>&#8242; = <italic>z</italic>[<italic>p</italic>(hit)] &#8211; <italic>z</italic>[<italic>p</italic>(false alarm)]. For the racial category learning task, because the average level of phenotypic racial features was the only criterion that differentiated the two groups, a higher <italic>d</italic>&#8242; indicated more efficient learning of race-based categories. That is, the participants would have higher <italic>d</italic>&#8242;s if they were better able to detect the between-group phenotypic racial differences and to use the detected group differences to improve their judgment accuracy. Similarly, for the spatial category learning task, a higher <italic>d</italic>&#8242; indicated higher efficiency in learning the implicit rule that governed the categorical membership of the dots. Following the category learning task, the participants completed a questionnaire package, in which the Racial Essentialism Scale and the demographic questions were embedded.</p>
<p align="left">We hypothesize that for both White and Asian Americans, racial essentialism would be related to greater efficiency in learning race-based categories, that is, higher <italic>d</italic>&#8242; in the racial category learning task; however, racial essentialism should be unrelated to efficiency in learning nonracial categories.</p>

As hypothesized, racial essentialism was related to efficiency in racial category learning (&#946; = .42), <italic>t</italic>(28) = 2.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, but not to that in spatial, nonracial categorical learning (&#946; = &#8722;.20), <italic>t</italic>(28) = &#8722;1.07, <italic>ns</italic>. That is, stronger endorsement of racial essentialism is associated with higher efficiency in acquiring an implicit racial categorization rule. Again, this effect did not differ between White and Asian American participants (&#946;s for the effects of participant race &lt; .21), <italic>t</italic>(54) &lt; |1.95|. <italic>ns</italic>.</p>
<p align="left">Taken together, the results demonstrated that racial essentialism is associated with efficiency in learning race-based categorization rules. Furthermore, as suggested by the nonsignificant association between racial essentialism and efficiency in acquiring spatial categorization rules, the relationship between racial essentialism and efficiency in acquiring implicit race-based categorization rules does not result from greater proficiency among racial essentialists in acquiring categorization rules in general.</p>

<title>Study 4: Threshold of Racial Categorization</title>
<p align="left">Having shown that racial essentialism is accompanied by a greater propensity and higher efficiency in race-based categorization, we proceeded to examine the hypothesized association between racial essentialism and sensitivity to subtle differences in phenotypic racial features (Hypothesis 2). We began by investigating the connection between racial essentialism and adherence to hypodescent norms. Again, given that racial classification in the United States has traditionally focused on &#8220;who is White&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr84-2" rid="c84">Yancey, 2003</xref>), we expect that racial essentialism is associated with greater sensitivity in detecting subtle racial features and include only those target faces with clear phenotypic features into the &#8220;White&#8221; racial category.</p>
<p align="left">In this study, by including both White and Asian American participants, we tested whether the higher threshold for classifying racially ambiguous faces reflects either an ingroup overexclusion bias among White participants only or a biased categorization practice associated with racial essentialism among both White and Asian American participants.</p>

<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p align="left">The participants were 58 undergraduate students (57% female; mean age = 18.81 years) at the University of Illinois. There were 30 White and 28 Asian participants. They participated in the study to receive course requirement credit. We adopted the method of constant stimuli to assess how &#8220;White&#8221; a stimulus person must look (in terms of phenotypic facial features; that is, the morph level of the stimulus photo) for the person to be categorized as White.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s32" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Method of constant stimuli</title>
<p align="left">Upon arrival, participants were seated in front of a computer in separate cubicles. They were told that the experiment concerned how people categorized others. The experimental task consisted of 100 trials. On each trial, a different stimulus photo of varying morph levels appeared on the computer screen, and the participant judged whether the stimulus person was &#8220;White&#8221; or &#8220;Black&#8221; by pressing <italic>1</italic> (&#8220;White) or <italic>2</italic> (&#8220;Black&#8221;) on a keypad. No accuracy feedback was given. The 100 stimulus photos were randomly sampled from each of the 10 morph levels of the stimulus set described in Study 3, and they were presented in a random order. Each photo was presented only once in the experiment.</p>
<p align="left">The dependent measure was the participants' <italic>racial categorization threshold</italic>, operationally defined as the point on the morphing continuum at which categorization was entirely random&#8212;that is, the participants categorized photos of that particular morph level as &#8220;White&#8221; or &#8220;Black&#8221; 50% of the time. Above this morph level, participants were more likely to include the morphed faces into the White category. Hence, a higher categorization threshold indicated that the participants required a face to possess more salient White phenotypic features to be categorized as White. To obtain the categorization threshold for each participant, following <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Agresti (1996)</xref>, we fitted a logistic regression, logit[&#960;(<italic>x</italic>)] = &#945; + &#946;<italic>x</italic>, to each participant's responses, with morph level as the independent variable (<italic>x</italic>) to obtain &#945; and &#946;. The racial categorization threshold, also known as the median effective level (EL<sub location="post">50</sub>), was determined using the formula EL<sub location="post">50</sub> = &#8722; &#945;/&#946;. Following the categorization task, the participants completed a questionnaire package, in which the Racial Essentialism Scale and the demographic questions were embedded.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p align="left">We regressed categorization threshold on racial essentialism (mean-centered), participant race (&#8722;1 = Asian, 1 = White), and their interaction. The hypothesized main effect of racial essentialism was significant (&#946; = .37), <italic>t</italic>(54) = 2.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Specifically, a stronger endorsement of the essentialist belief was associated with a higher categorization threshold for biracial faces to be included into the &#8220;White&#8221; category. Such categorization strategy reflected an essentialist tendency to follow the hypodescent norms. The main effect and interaction effect of participant race were not significant (&#946; = .22), <italic>t</italic>(54) = 1.73, <italic>ns</italic>; and (&#946; = &#8722;.05), <italic>t</italic>(54) = 0.42, <italic>ns</italic>, respectively, suggesting that the effect of essentialism did not differ between White and Asian participants.</p>
<p align="left">As noted earlier, to the extent that racial essentialism is associated with a greater tendency to classify people into racial categories by phenotypic racial characteristics, when the perceiver focuses on determining whether the target is White (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr84-3" rid="c84">Yancey, 2003</xref>), racial essentialism should be accompanied by stronger adherence to the hypodescent norms by default. This prediction was supported in the current study. Furthermore, as the lay theory perspective predicts, Asian American participants and their White counterparts displayed the same pattern of results, suggesting that this result pattern was not driven by an ingroup exclusion bias among White participants. A limitation of the current study is that we did not specifically require the participants to determine the group membership of White or that of Black. We expected that if the participants are asked to judge whether the target is White, endorsement of essentialism should be associated with a higher threshold for admitting the target to the White category on the basis of phenotypic Whiteness, as indicated by a stronger adherence to the hypodescent norms. However, if the participants are asked to judge whether the target is Black, endorsement of essentialism should also be associated with a higher threshold for admitting the target to the Black category on the basis of phenotypic Blackness.</p>

<title>Study 5: Sensitivity to Phenotypic Features of Black and White</title>
<p align="left">In the current study, we used the method of difference in psychophysics to measure sensitivity to phenotypic features in racial categorization toward both Black and White targets. We hypothesize that high (vs. low) essentialists would be more sensitive to subtle differences in phenotypic racial characteristics in the categorization process. Thus, when the categorization process requires determination of White group membership, they would be more sensitive to subtle variations in phenotypic Whiteness. However, when the categorization process requires determination of Black group membership, they would be more sensitive to minute variations in phenotypic Blackness. Taken together, racial essentialism is hypothesized to be associated with greater sensitivity to phenotypic racial variations in general, regardless of the racial group membership of the perceivers and the perceived. To further examine the generalizability of the association between racial essentialism and race-based categorization processes across racial groups, White, Asian, as well as Black participants were recruited for this study.</p>
<sec id="s35" disp-level="subsect1">

<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p align="left">The participants were 104 undergraduate students at the University of Illinois (61% female; mean age = 19.25 years). There were 32 White, 31 Asian, and 41 Black participants. They received either course requirement credit or $8 for their participation. Upon arrival, participants were seated in front of a computer in separate cubicles. They were told that the study concerned categorization. Using the method of difference in psychophysics, in each trial, two faces appeared on the screen side-by-side. The participants' task was to decide which one of the two faces, labeled as <italic>1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>, was more likely to belong to a certain racial group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s37" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Method of difference</title>
<p align="left">The stimulus photos were sampled from the pool of 300 morphed stimulus faces in the stimulus set we described in Study 3. There were two blocks of trials: the Black-target block and the White-target block. The order of the two blocks was counterbalanced. For each trial in the Black-target block, participants were presented with an original Black face (Level 1; 0% White:100% Black) and a morphed face of another person. The morph level of the morphed faces ranged from Level 2 (11% White:89% Black) to Level 5 (44% White:56% Black). The participants were asked, &#8220;Who is more likely to be Black?&#8221; and they responded by pressing a number on the keypad that corresponded to the picture label (<italic>1</italic> for Picture 1; <italic>2</italic> for Picture 2). There were 60 trials in this block, with 15 trials for each morph level (Levels 2, 3, 4, and 5). The placement (left and right) of the original face and the morphed face was randomized across trials. The trials were presented to the participants in a random order.</p>
<p align="left">Similarly, for each trial in the White-target block, participants were presented with an original White face (Level 10; 100% White:0% Black) and a morphed face of another person. The morph level of the morphed faces ranged from Level 6 (56% White: 44% Black) to Level 9 (89% White:11% Black). The participants were asked, &#8220;Who is more likely to be White?&#8221; They responded by pressing the corresponding number on a keypad. Again, there were 60 trials in this block, with 15 trials for each morph level (Levels 6, 7, 8, and 9). The trials were presented to the participants in a random order. Note that in the Black-target block, faces at Level 5 were farthest away from the original faces (Level 1) on the morphing continuum. Likewise, in the White-target block, faces at Level 6 were farthest away from the original faces (Level 10).</p>
<p align="left">The dependent measures were the participants' accuracy rates (0 to 100%) in differentiating the original faces (Level 1 or Level 10 faces) from the morphed faces at different morph levels in the Black-target and White-target blocks. That is, for each participant, there were eight accuracy rates: accuracy rates for morphed faces that were one, two, three, or four levels away from the original Black or White faces. Following the categorization task, the participants completed the Racial Essentialism Scale and the demographic questions embedded in a questionnaire package.</p>
<p align="left">We predicted that the greater the number of morphed levels a face was away from the original face, the easier it would be for the individuals to select the original face in a pair. Thus, in the Black-target block, participants' accuracy rates should increase when the morph level of the faces increased from Level 2 (11% White:89% Black, where discrimination of the original Black face from the morphed face was most difficult) to Level 5 (44% White:56% Black, where discrimination of the original Black face from the morphed face was easiest). Similarly, in the White-target block, accuracy rates should increase from Level 9 (89% White:11% Black) to Level 6 (56% White:44% Black).</p>
<p align="left">More importantly, we expected racial essentialism to moderate the effect of morph level: Racial essentialism would be associated with heightened sensitivity to subtle phenotypic racial differences. Therefore, stronger belief in racial essentialism should be associated with higher accuracy in both the Black- and White-target blocks. More importantly, the effect of racial essentialism should be most pronounced when the morphed faces were two or three morph levels from the original faces, because in these trials, discrimination of the original face from the morphed one was neither overly challenging nor extremely easy.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p align="left">The number of morph levels away from the original face and the race of the targets were nested within participants. Therefore, we performed multilevel analysis to test our hypotheses. First, we tested the hypothesis that higher racial essentialism would be accompanied by a stronger quadratic effect of morph level on accuracy rate. For each participant, we performed the following polynomial regression analysis on accuracy:</p>
<p align="left">Accuracy Rate = <italic>a</italic> + <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1</italic></sub> &#215; Morph Level (Linear) + <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2</italic></sub> &#215; Morph Level (Quadratic), in which the linear contrast of the four morph levels was coded as c(&#8722;3, &#8722;1, 1, 3) and the quadratic contrast was coded as c(1, &#8722;1, &#8722;1, 1).</p>
<p align="left">In this analysis, the size of <italic>a</italic> represents the overall level of accuracy, the <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1</italic></sub> represents the extent to which accuracy tended to increase linearly when the number of morph levels away from the original face increased, and <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2</italic></sub> represents the extent to which accuracy tended to change nonlinearly with the number of morph levels away from the original face. The mean of the estimated <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1</italic></sub> was 0.037 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.018), which was significantly higher than zero, <italic>t</italic>(103) = 21.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. This result indicated that accuracy was higher as the number of morph levels away from the original face increased. The mean of estimated <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2</italic></sub> was 0.037 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.038), which was also significantly different from zero, <italic>t</italic>(103) = 10.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In short, as the number of morph levels away from the original face increased, accuracy increased nonlinearly.</p>
<p align="left">Next, across participants, we tested whether the within-participants coefficients (<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1</italic>,</sub> and <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2</italic></sub>) were related to racial essentialism (mean-centered), participant race (Contrast 1: &#8722;1 = Asian, &#8722;1 = Black, 2 = White; Contrast 2: &#8722;1 = Asian, 1 = Black, 0 = White), and their interaction. The result revealed that racial essentialism was associated with overall accuracy (<italic>a</italic> in the within-participants regressions) (<italic>b</italic> = 0.01), <italic>t</italic>(98) = 2.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and quadratic effect of morph level (<italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2</italic></sub> in the within-participants regression) (<italic>b</italic> = &#8722;0.10), <italic>t</italic>(98) = &#8722;2.60, <italic>p</italic> = .01, but not with linear effect of morph level (<italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1</italic></sub> in the within-participants regression) (<italic>b</italic> = 0.002), <italic>t</italic>(98) = 1.05, <italic>ns.</italic> The main and interaction effects of participant race were not significant (<italic>b</italic>s &lt; |0.005|), <italic>t</italic>(98) &lt; |1.20|, <italic>ns</italic>. This result, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc3-1" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, suggested that participants who endorsed racial essentialism more strongly were more accurate in racial categorization in general, and the effect was particularly pronounced when the faces were two or three morph levels from the original faces.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig3"/></p>
<p align="left">Next, as a robust test, we examined whether target race moderated the relationship of racial essentialism with the quadratic effect of morph level on accuracy (<italic>b</italic><sub location="post">2</sub>). For each participant, we performed the following polynomial regression analysis on the recognition accuracy of Black and White faces separately:</p>
<p align="left">Accuracy<sub location="post">BLACK</sub> = <italic>a</italic><sub location="post"><italic>BLACK</italic></sub> + <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1.BLACK</italic></sub> &#215; Morph Level (Linear) + <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2.BLACK</italic></sub> &#215; Morph Level (Quadratic).</p>
<p align="left">Accuracy<sub location="post">WHITE</sub> = <italic>a</italic><sub location="post"><italic>WHITE</italic></sub> + <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1.WHITE</italic></sub> &#215; Morph Level (Linear) + <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2.WHITE</italic></sub> &#215; Morph Level (Quadratic).</p>
<p align="left">Next, we took the difference between the estimated parameters from the two regression equations: <italic>a</italic><sub location="post"><italic>WHITE</italic></sub> <italic>&#8722; a</italic><sub location="post"><italic>BLACK</italic></sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1.WHITE</italic></sub> <italic>&#8722; b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1.BLACK</italic></sub>; and <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2.WHITE</italic></sub> <italic>&#8722; b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2.BLACK</italic></sub>, <italic>a</italic><sub location="post"><italic>WHITE</italic></sub> &#8722; <italic>a</italic><sub location="post"><italic>BLACK</italic></sub> represent the magnitude of the main effect of target race on accuracy, <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1.WHITE</italic></sub> &#8722; <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1.BLACK</italic></sub> represents the magnitude of the target race and the linear effect of morph level on accuracy, and <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2.WHITE</italic></sub> &#8722; <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2.BLACK</italic></sub> represents the magnitude of the target race and the quadratic effect of morph level on accuracy. The mean of <italic>a</italic><sub location="post"><italic>WHITE</italic></sub> &#8722; <italic>a</italic><sub location="post"><italic>BLACK</italic></sub> was exactly 0. The mean of <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1.WHITE</italic></sub> &#8722;<italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1.BLACK</italic></sub> (<italic>M</italic> = &#8722;0.008, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.032) and that of <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2.WHITE</italic></sub> &#8722; <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2.BLACK</italic></sub> (<italic>M</italic> = &#8722;0.046, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.077) also did not differ from zero, |<italic>t</italic>| &lt; 0.06, <italic>ns</italic>. In short, the overall recognition accuracy for Black faces did not differ significantly from that for White faces, and the effects of morph levels on recognition accuracy were not significantly different for Black and White faces.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, we tested whether racial essentialism, participant race, and their interaction were associated with each of the difference parameters. The effects of racial essentialism, participant race, as well as their interaction were not significant on any of the three parameters (<italic>b</italic>s &lt; |0.03|), <italic>t</italic>(98) &lt; |1.95|, <italic>ns</italic>, for <italic>a</italic><sub location="post"><italic>WHITE</italic></sub> &#8722; <italic>a</italic><sub location="post"><italic>BLACK</italic></sub> (<italic>b</italic>s &lt; |0.06|), <italic>t</italic>(98) &lt; |1.46|, <italic>ns</italic>, for <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1.WHITE</italic></sub> &#8722; <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1.BLACK</italic></sub>(<italic>b</italic>s &lt; |0.03|), and <italic>t</italic>(98) &lt; |1.79|, <italic>ns</italic>, for <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2.WHITE</italic></sub> &#8722; <italic>b</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2.BLACK</italic></sub>. That is, the race of the target did not moderate the magnitude of the main effect of target race on accuracy, the interaction of target race and the linear effect of morph level on accuracy, and the interaction of target race and the quadratic effect of morph level on accuracy.</p>
<p align="left">In summary, these results provided support to the hypothesis that racial essentialism was associated with increased sensitivity to variations in phenotypic racial cues. In addition, similar effects were found with both Black and White targets. Furthermore, the associations between essentialism and racial categorization among Asian, Black, and White participants did not differ from each other. This finding further supports the argument that the relationship between racial essentialism and racial categorization cannot be attributed to the ingroup exclusion bias among White perceivers. Instead, the overall pattern of results is consistent with the predictions of the lay theory perspective.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p align="left">Racial classification has been a salient issue in public discourse and has important implications on racialized perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-2" rid="c6">Brunsma, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr73-2" rid="c73">Saulny, 2011</xref>). Some individuals believe that racial categorization is a valid and useful way of classifying people into meaningful social categories, whereas others disagree with this contention. The current research reveals how racial essentialism as a lay theory is related to preferences in racial categorization practices. The contributions of the current research are twofold. First, it extends research on the relationship between lay theories of personal attributes and trait-based categorization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr80-3" rid="c80">Tong &amp; Chiu, 2002</xref>) to the intergroup domain by elucidating the relationship between lay theories of race and racial classification practices. This investigation is theoretically significant because it sheds light on how lay theories of race guide categorization practices: from the proclivity to engage in racial (vs. nonracial) categorization to sensitivity to phenotypic racial features. It opens the &#8220;black box&#8221; between lay theory and the sense-making process by revealing how subtle assumptions about race color the way perceivers structure and make sense of their social environment. Second, racial essentialism has been linked to various consequences in racialized perceptions and reactions. For example, individuals who endorse an essentialist theory more tend to possess stronger stereotypes of and prejudices against racial minority groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-2" rid="c52">Jayaratne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-2" rid="c54">Keller, 2005</xref>), and a reduced desire to interact with racial outgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr83-2" rid="c83">Williams &amp; Eberhardt, 2008</xref>), compared with those who endorse this lay theory less. These findings have deepened our understanding of the potential consequences of racial essentialism on intergroup relations. Nonetheless, the relationship between racial essentialism and racial categorization practices is still unclear. The current research represents the first systematic attempt that adopts established experimental paradigms in cognitive science to investigate these links. Using diverse experimental paradigms across five studies, this program of research adds to the critical discourse on racial classification by linking racial categorization practices to racial essentialism. Specifically, we found that, compared with individuals who believe less strongly in racial essentialism, those who endorse this belief more strongly categorize people along racial lines more readily (Studies 1&#8211;3). They are also more sensitive to variations in phenotypic traits of a racial category and adopt more stringent phenotypic criteria when judging the racial category of a target (Studies 4&#8211;5).</p>
<sec id="s40" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Understanding Racial Categorization</title>
<p align="left">Lay people formulate theories to make sense of their social environment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-2" rid="c13">Chiu, Hong, &amp; Dweck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-4" rid="c47">Hong et al., 1999</xref>). Their theories about the malleability of human attributes guide the categorization of social information by increasing the perceived relevance of a certain dimension as the basis of categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-2" rid="c29">Gelman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-2" rid="c63">Medin, 1989</xref>). Findings from Studies 1&#8211;3 demonstrated that people who believe in immutable racial essence more strongly perceive race as an important categorization cue and tend to structure their social world along racial lines. Specifically, racial essentialism was experimentally manipulated in Study 1 to demonstrate the causal effect of racial essentialism on race-based categorization. In Studies 2 and 3, we examined racial essentialism as a chronic belief and its associated race-based categorization tendency. Using a modified triad categorization task (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-7" rid="c53">Ji et al., 2004</xref>) and a category learning paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-6" rid="c62">Markman et al., 2005</xref>), we found that racial essentialism is consistently associated with the readiness to make race-based, but not nonrace-based, categorization. More importantly, these results were observed among both White and Asian Americans, suggesting that essentialist theory of race sets up preferences in racial classification that influence racial majority and minority group members similarly.</p>
<p align="left">Using an established paradigm in psychophysics, we found in Study 4 that racial essentialism is accompanied by the tendency to set a higher threshold of &#8220;Whiteness&#8221; for biracial faces to be categorized as White. That is, those who endorse racial essentialism more tend to adhere to the hypodescent norms more. Traditionally, adherence to the hypodescent norms have been associated with the motivation to avoid false inclusion of outgroup members into the ingroup&#8212;the ingroup overexclusion effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-3" rid="c57">Leyens &amp; Yzerbyt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr86-2" rid="c86">Yzerbyt et al., 1995</xref>). Our findings, however, revealed that the association between racial essentialism and racial classification of individuals does not always stem from the motivation of the majority group to maintain ingroup purity and to reinforce White dominance. Instead, racial essentialism sets up a preferred information-processing style that supports racial categorization on the basis of phenotypic manifestations of race, which is a salient aspect of race in racial discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Clark &amp; Clark, 1939</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">1940</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">1950</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, we found in Study 4 that the relationship between racial essentialism and racial categorization threshold held for both Whites and Asian Americans. In Study 5, we further showed that, regardless of racial ingroup&#8211;outgroup membership and majority&#8211;minority status, when the categorization process requires determination of whether a target person is White, racial essentialism is associated with greater sensitivity to phenotypic variations in Whiteness. Likewise, when the categorization task requires determination of whether a target person is Black, racial essentialism is associated with greater sensitivity to phenotypic variations in Blackness.</p>
<p align="left">These results have important implications for understanding racial classification. Although ingroup overexclusion can result from the motivation to maintain ingroup purity and social dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-4" rid="c57">Leyens &amp; Yzerbyt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr86-3" rid="c86">Yzerbyt et al., 1995</xref>), the phenomena of ingroup overexclusion and group membership overexclusion may also arise from lay theory-driven preferences in racial categorization. Future studies can investigate the interplays of how identity motives may reinforce or mitigate the effect of lay essentialism on various racial categorization practices. It would also be interesting to explore whether individuals who endorse racial essentialism less strongly are <italic>unable</italic> or <italic>unwilling</italic> to engage in race-based information processing compared with those who endorse these beliefs more strongly. This issue can be addressed by manipulating the payoff structure of the categorization tasks to see whether incentivizing performance would alter the categorization strategies used (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-7" rid="c62">Markman et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>From Racial Categorization to Racialized Perceptions</title>
<p align="left">The characteristic racial categorization practices associated with racial essentialism could have important implications for racialized perceptions and racial stereotype formation. Social perceivers often attribute observed behavioral patterns of racial group members to their group characteristics and infer correspondent traits in the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr60-1" rid="c60">Mackie, Hamilton, Susskind, &amp; Rosselli, 1996</xref>). That is, observers tend to infer correspondent traits about social groups on the basis of behavioral patterns of their group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-2" rid="c70">Prentice &amp; Miller, 2006</xref>). Racial essentialism may influence the manner this bias manifests. The current research has demonstrated that racial essentialism is associated with a greater tendency to only include individuals with clear phenotypic racial markers into a racial category. Reasoning along this line, when making inferences about the psychological characteristics of a particular racial group, perceivers who endorse racial essentialism more strongly might form correspondent trait inferences about racial groups on the basis of the behaviors of members who possess clear phenotypic racial characteristics. This would be an important future direction because it could potentially shed light on the mixed findings in past research regarding the relationship between racial essentialism and prejudice toward racial minorities.</p>
<p align="left">In particular, some studies have found a positive relationship between essentialist beliefs and negative attitudes toward minority groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">Hewstone, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-3" rid="c52">Jayaratne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-3" rid="c54">Keller, 2005</xref>), whereas other studies have reported weak or inconsistent associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-2" rid="c35">Haslam et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-2" rid="c36">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">Hegarty &amp; Pratto, 2001</xref>). Building from the current research, we speculate that racial essentialism per se is not always accompanied by negative racialized perceptions. Racial essentialism supports race-based categorization and the tendency to make group inferences on the basis of the behaviors of the &#8220;pure&#8221; exemplars with unambiguous phenotypic features. Thus, racial essentialists would infer negative traits in a racial group when they encounter negative behaviors from individuals with clear phenotypic characteristics of that group. However, they would infer positive traits in a racial group when they encounter positive behaviors from these same individuals. This reasoning further implies that racial essentialists would not readily make evaluative inferences of a racial group when they encounter individuals who do not possess clear phenotypic markers of the group. In short, racial essentialism might not necessarily be accompanied by negative racialized perceptions, although it supports polarization of racialized group inferences on the basis of behaviors of individuals with clear phenotypic racial features. Such potential effects of racial essentialism on racial perceptions merit future research attention.</p>
<p align="left">Furthermore, some researchers have contended that mere exposure to the mass media about the biological determinants of racial categories can reinforce essentialist beliefs and lead to intergroup tension, such as increases in anti-Black attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Condit, Parrott, Bates, Bevan, &amp; Achter, 2004</xref>) and reduction in engagement with racial inequality issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr83-3" rid="c83">Williams &amp; Eberhardt, 2008</xref>). Future research on racial essentialism and racial categorization may extend this contention. Specifically, media exposure that reinforces racial essentialism could strengthen anti-Black attitudes particularly when there is <italic>also</italic> extensive media coverage of negative behaviors exhibited by African Americans who are seen as prototypic of the group. From this perspective, in the United States, to the extent that racial minority faces are overwhelmingly associated with negative attributes in the popular culture (e.g., poor, lazy, incompetent, criminal; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Berry, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Graves, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-1" rid="c58">Lichter, Lichter, Rothman, &amp; Amundson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr65-1" rid="c65">Merritt &amp; Stroman, 1993</xref>), frequent exposure to supporting arguments for racial essentialism can increase prejudice and reduce interest in interacting with ethnic minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr83-4" rid="c83">Williams &amp; Eberhardt, 2008</xref>). Interventions that aim at reducing prejudices against racial minorities can attempt to alter individuals' beliefs in racial essentialism or to weaken the spontaneous tendency to associate racial minority groups with negative attributes and to highlight diversity within the minority groups. These possibilities also merit future research attention.</p>

<title>Understanding Essentialism and Intraindividual Processes in Global Context</title>
<p align="left">With the rapid increase in intergroup contacts, research on essentialism has drawn increasing attention in recent years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Dar-Nimrod &amp; Heine, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Haslam, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr81-1" rid="c81">Turkheimer, 2011</xref>). Despite abundant research demonstrating a link between essentialist beliefs and intergroup biases (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-2" rid="c18">Dar-Nimrod &amp; Heine, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-1" rid="c56">Levy et al., 2006</xref>), researchers have just started exploring the influence of essentialist beliefs on intraindividual processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-4" rid="c9">Chao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-9" rid="c67">No et al., 2008</xref>). The current research represents an important step in identifying the intrapsychological processes underlying the essentialism and intergroup perception.</p>
<p align="left">Given the increased frequency of intercultural contacts in this increasingly globalized world, essentialist beliefs could also have important implications for individuals navigating multicultural terrains (see <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Chao, Okazaki, &amp; Hong, 2011</xref>). On the one hand, essentialist beliefs can heighten perceivers' sensitivity toward differences between themselves and foreign values to promote cross-cultural understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Fischer, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, perceived value dissimilarity with the outgroup is associated with increased intergroup hostility (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-1" rid="c74">Schwartz, Struch, &amp; Bilsky, 1990</xref>) and reduced willingness to interact with the outgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-1" rid="c72">Sagiv &amp; Schwartz, 1995</xref>). Future studies can explore the circumstances under which essentialism would foster intercultural understanding, and when it would lead to intergroup conflicts and hostilities.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p align="left">Issues of racial essentialism, racial categorization, and racial perception are intertwined; the current article reports the first known systematic investigation in which cognitive experimental paradigms were used to investigate their intricate relationships. It also extends research on lay theories of personal attributes (e.g., personality, intelligence) to the intergroup domain and opens the &#8220;black box&#8221; between lay theory and the sense-making process by revealing how subtle assumptions about race color the way perceivers structure and make sense of their social environment. Across five studies adopting diverse experimental designs, we have demonstrated how lay theories about race bias racial categorization practices. Findings from our studies also advance current understanding of the link between essentialism and intergroup relations. As such, insights from the current investigation add new evidence-based social psychological contents to the public discourse on intergroup attitudes. We hope that insights from the current investigation will contribute new social psychological contents to the public discourse on racial issues, raise collective consciousness on a key racial belief that is connected to racial classification practices, and inspire future studies in which social policies and practices that promote intergroup understanding and harmony are examined.</p>
