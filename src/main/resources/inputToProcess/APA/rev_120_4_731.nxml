<abstract xml:lang="en">
<p align="left">The idea that behavior is selected by its consequences in a process analogous to organic evolution has been discussed for over 100 years. A recently proposed theory instantiates this idea by means of a genetic algorithm that operates on a population of potential behaviors. Behaviors in the population are represented by numbers in decimal integer (phenotypic) and binary bit string (genotypic) forms. One behavior from the population is emitted at random each time tick, after which a new population of potential behaviors is constructed by recombining parent behavior bit strings. If the emitted behavior produced a benefit to the organism, then parents are chosen on the basis of their phenotypic similarity to the emitted behavior; otherwise, they are chosen at random. After parent behavior recombination, the population is subjected to a small amount of mutation by flipping random bits in the population&#8217;s bit strings. The behavior generated by this process of selection, reproduction, and mutation reaches equilibrium states that conform to every empirically valid equation of matching theory, exactly and without systematic error. These equations are known to describe the behavior of many vertebrate species, including humans, in a variety of experimental, naturalistic, natural, and social environments. The evolutionary theory also generates instantaneous dynamics and patterns of preference change in constantly changing environments that are consistent with the dynamics of live-organism behavior. These findings support the assertion that the world of behavior we observe and measure is generated by evolutionary dynamics.</p>

<p align="left">Since at least the early 1900s, psychologists, zoologists, philosophers of science, economists, neuroscientists, social theorists, and behavior analysts have commented on the analogy between learning and evolution. Even Edward Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr116-1" rid="c116">Thorndike (1898)</xref> suggested that his law of effect could be understood as a form of Darwinian selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Donahoe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1" rid="c47">Henriques, 2003)</xref>. Perhaps the earliest detailed account of the idea of learning as evolution was given by the British zoologist, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr92-1" rid="c92">J. W. S. Pringle (1951)</xref>, who also proposed a neural mechanism that entailed a kind of variation and selection. Another detailed treatment of this idea was published about the same time by Nobel-prize-winning economist, social theorist, philosopher of science, and pioneer of complexity theory, Friedrich <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Hayek (1952a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1" rid="c46">1952b</xref>). Other relatively early commentators included <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Campbell (1960)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr97-1" rid="c97">W. M. S. Russell (1962)</xref>. In 1971 the psychologists J. E. R. Staddon and Virginia Simmelhag published an influential article in the <italic>Psychological Review</italic> in which they proposed abandoning the response strength interpretation of the effect of resource acquisition on behavior in favor of a selectionist interpretation:
<disp-quote>
<p align="left">Thus, both evolution and learning can be regarded as the outcome of two independent processes: a process of variation that generates either phenotypes, in the case of evolution, or behavior, in the case of learning; and a process of selection that acts within the limits set by the first process. (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr113-1" rid="c113">Staddon &amp; Simmelhag, 1971</xref>, p. 18)</p>
</disp-quote>
Since Staddon and Simmelhag&#8217;s seminal article, the idea that learning might be understood as the evolution of behavior or, equivalently, as the result of Darwinian selection, has been widely discussed by psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">Catania, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Donahoe, Burgos, &amp; Palmer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">Gilbert, 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1" rid="c41">Glenn &amp; Field, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Glen &amp; Madden, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-2" rid="c47">Henriques, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr105-1" rid="c105">Skinner, 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr106-1" rid="c106">1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr107-1" rid="c107">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr111-1" rid="c111">Staddon, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr119-1" rid="c119">Wasserman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr120-1" rid="c120">Wasserman &amp; Blumberg, 2010)</xref>, neuroscientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">Edelman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Fuster, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">1997</xref>), sociologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Blute, 1979)</xref>, social theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-1" rid="c56">Hughes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-1" rid="c57">Hull, Langman, &amp; Glenn, 2001)</xref>, and philosophers of science (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr95-1" rid="c95">Ringen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr108-1" rid="c108">Smith, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr109-1" rid="c109">1986</xref>).</p>

<p align="left">at the present stage of knowledge, this [selectionist] approach is simply an analogy, although a compelling one, and cannot yet be called an evolutionary theory of learning. However, it provides a beginning and may lead to a truly evolutionary account which can securely imbed the study of learning in the broader field of biology. (p. 17)</p>
</disp-quote>
A candidate for such an account is the recently proposed evolutionary theory of adaptive behavior dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-1" rid="c70">McDowell, 2004)</xref>. This is a quantitative theory that instantiates the idea of selection by consequences in the form of a genetic algorithm. In the next three sections of this article, the theory is explained in general terms, and evidence supporting it is presented. Following this, a possible material mechanism for the theory is considered, along with avenues for further development of the theory, including its extension to social behavior. Finally, other theories of behavior dynamics, and problems that arise when comparing theories, are discussed.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>The Evolutionary Theory of Adaptive Behavior Dynamics</title>
<p align="left">Because the evolutionary theory is an instance of complexity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr73-1" rid="c73">McDowell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr80-1" rid="c80">McDowell &amp; Popa, 2009)</xref>, it is helpful to briefly consider complexity theories in general.</p>
<sec id="s3" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Complexity Theory</title>
<p align="left">A complexity theory is usually stated in the form of a small set of relatively simple rules. The rules are applied repeatedly, usually by means of a computer program, to generate an outcome that can be compared to data. The outcomes of an instance of complexity theory are often said to be emergent properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-1" rid="c55">Holland, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr73-2" rid="c73">McDowell, 2013)</xref> of the theory, inasmuch as they typically cannot be deduced in advance from the theory&#8217;s rules.</p>
<p align="left">More traditional theories that make use of differential equations usually extract important variables from the phenomena of interest or, equivalently, simplify or idealize the phenomena so that mathematical statements about them can be formulated. These theories are most applicable when it is reasonable to consider one or more independent variables as the efficient cause of one or more dependent variables. Some phenomena, however, may be subject to a different kind of causation, where a small set of causal processes, each acting relatively locally and independently, produce the observed phenomena as a cumulative result of their combined operation. Even if it were possible to generate a calculus-based account of a simplified or idealized version of such phenomena, it would not be an accurate causal account. Instead, a rules-based complexity theory would be required, where the rules described the low-level causal processes that jointly produced the observed phenomena.</p>
<p align="left">Complexity theories are often computationally irreducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr123-1" rid="c123">Wolfram, 2002)</xref>, which means that their implications or predictions cannot be worked out by any set of mathematical operations, or by any computational short cut. Instead, the rules that constitute the theory must be applied repeatedly to reveal the theory&#8217;s higher level output. In addition to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr80-2" rid="c80">McDowell and Popa&#8217;s (2009)</xref> discussion of complexity theory, and as noted in their article, John <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1" rid="c54">Holland (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-2" rid="c55">1998</xref>) and Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Bentley (2001)</xref> have written interesting and accessible accounts of various applications of complexity theory, including applications to biological phenomena. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr73-3" rid="c73">McDowell (2013)</xref> has discussed applications of complexity theory to behavioral phenomena, and <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr84-1" rid="c84">Miller and Page (2007)</xref> have discussed larger-scale social applications. There is no doubt that complexity theories are being pursued actively in many sciences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr98-1" rid="c98">Santa Fe Institute, 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s4" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Rules of the Evolutionary Theory</title>
<p align="left">The evolutionary theory of adaptive behavior dynamics consists of a set of rules that operates on a population of potential behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-2" rid="c70">McDowell, 2004)</xref>. The behaviors are potential in the sense that they may or may not be emitted by a virtual organism that is animated by the theory. The rules that constitute the theory are the Darwinian rules of selection, reproduction, and mutation.</p>
<sec id="s5" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Population of potential behaviors</title>
<p align="left">Each behavior in a population of potential behaviors is represented by an integer, which is referred to as the behavior&#8217;s phenotype. Similar behaviors have similar integer phenotypes, and ranges of integer phenotypes can represent classes of behavior. For example, behavioral phenotypes from 0 through 40 might represent different topographies of a target behavior in an experimental environment. The integer phenotype of a behavior can also be expressed in binary from, that is, as a string of 0s and 1s. This binary representation, or bit string, constitutes the behavior&#8217;s genotype.</p>
<p align="left">A population of potential behaviors has three properties. They are the range of phenotypes used to represent behaviors in the population, the <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1" rid="c44">Hamming (1950)</xref> distances between genotypes of the behaviors, and the number of behaviors in the population. The range of phenotypes also determines the number of bits required to represent a behavior&#8217;s genotype. For example, a range of phenotypes that extends from 0 through 511 requires nine bits (111111111 = 511) to represent the genotypes in that range; a range that extends from 0 through 1023 requires 10 bits, and so on. The Hamming distance between two genotypes of equal length is the number of bits that must be changed in order to convert one genotype into the other. For example, using 10-bit strings, the Hamming distance between 511 (= 0111111111) and 512 (= 1000000000) is 10, while the Hamming distance between 512 and 513 (= 1000000001) is 1. Hamming distances that separate classes of behavior serve an important function in the evolutionary theory, as is discussed later. For reference, the three properties of a population of potential behaviors are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-1" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Section I. <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc2-1" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> shows a population of 100 potential behaviors spanning a phenotype range that extends from 0 through 1023.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig1"/><xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig2"/></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Selection</title>
<p align="left">The operation of the theory begins with the emission of a behavior at random from the population of potential behaviors. After a behavior is emitted, pairs of parent behaviors are chosen from the population and are recombined to produce child behaviors, which constitute the next generation of potential behaviors. If the behavior that was emitted from the population resulted in the acquisition of a resource or the escape from or avoidance of a threat, then parent behaviors are chosen on the basis of their similarity to the behavior that produced the outcome, which is to say, on the basis of what may be referred to as their fitness. The closer a given behavior&#8217;s integer value to the integer value of the behavior that was emitted, the fitter that behavior is, and hence the more likely it is to be chosen as a parent. If the emitted behavior did not result in resource acquisition or threat escape or avoidance, then parent behaviors are chosen at random from the population of potential behaviors. Specific selection methods, which are discussed later, entail a single parameter that reflects the strength of the selection event. Stronger selection events result in fitter parents being chosen for mating.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Reproduction</title>
<p align="left">Each pair of parent behaviors produces a child behavior by contributing some of its bits to the child. For example, in bitwise recombination, the probability that a specific bit in the child&#8217;s genotype will come from the same location in the father&#8217;s genotype is 0.5; otherwise it will come from that location in the mother&#8217;s genotype. This type of recombination is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc2-2" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>. Recombination of parental genotypes produces child phenotypes that are more or less similar to the father&#8217;s, the mother&#8217;s, or both parents&#8217; phenotypes. In other words, fitter parent behaviors, which are behaviors that are more similar to the behavior that just produced a benefit to the organism, tend to produce fitter child behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Mutation</title>
<p align="left">Once a new generation of potential behaviors has been produced, the population is subjected to a small amount of mutation. For example, a random bit may be flipped in the genotypes of a few behaviors chosen at random from the population. This type of mutation is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc2-3" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>. Specific mutation methods, which are discussed later, entail a parameter that specifies the mutation rate.</p>
<p align="left">After a new population of potential behaviors undergoes mutation, a behavior is emitted at random from the population, and the process of selection, reproduction, and mutation is repeated. This yields a continuous stream of emitted behavior across generations, or time ticks, that can be recorded and studied just as if it were the behavior of a live organism. The operation of the evolutionary theory is illustrated by the flow chart in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc3-1" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The shaded boxes represent the three rules of the evolutionary theory.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig3"/></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Discussion of the rules</title>
<p align="left">Both recombination without selection (i.e., when parents are chosen at random) and mutation cause behaviors in the population of potential behaviors to vary, that is, the behavioral phenotypes tend to become distributed throughout their permissible range. Recombination with selection (i.e., when parents are chosen on the basis of fitness) has the opposite effect. It causes the behaviors in the population to become relatively concentrated near the emitted behavior. In a constant environment&#8212;for example, one that affords occasional resources for behaviors emitted from a target range of phenotypes&#8212;the opposing forces of variation and selection reach a balance, at which point a roughly constant rate of behavior is emitted from the target range or class. This is a steady-state, or dynamic equilibrium, of the evolutionary theory.</p>
<p align="left">The repeated application of specific selection, reproduction, and mutation rules to a population of items constitutes a genetic algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">Goldberg, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1" rid="c53">Holland, 1975)</xref>. Genetic algorithms may implement different selection, reproduction, and mutation rules, which are often called operators, but all implement some form of these rules. Genetic algorithms are most commonly used to find optimal solutions to problems that are difficult or impossible to optimize with more traditional mathematical methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-2" rid="c43">Goldberg, 1989)</xref>. When used in this way, the specifics of the operators typically are not critical. The algorithm only needs to yield an optimal or near-optimal solution efficiently. In the evolutionary theory, on the other hand, the genetic algorithm has a very different function inasmuch as there is no set problem to which an optimal solution is sought. Instead, the genetic algorithm simply causes a population of potential behaviors to evolve. When specific behaviors occasionally result in adaptive outcomes, such as escape from threat, then those behaviors and others like them tend to become represented more frequently in the population of potential behaviors, which means that they are more likely to be emitted when a behavior is chosen at random from the population.</p>
<p align="left">To summarize the properties and parameters of the evolutionary theory, recall that the population of potential behaviors is characterized by three quantitative properties, namely, the range of permissible integer phenotypes (and consequently the number of bits required to represent their genotypes), the Hamming distances between binary genotypes (and hence between behavioral classes), and the number of behaviors in the population. The Darwinian rules of selection, reproduction, and mutation entail two quantitative parameters, which are the strength of the selection event and the mutation rate. For reference, these properties and parameters are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-2" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Sections I and II.</p>

<title>Specific Selection, Reproduction, and Mutation Operators</title>
<sec id="s11" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Selection operators</title>
<p align="left">Common methods of implementing selection in genetic algorithms include population truncation and tournament competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-3" rid="c43">Goldberg, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr96-1" rid="c96">S. Russell &amp; Norvig, 2003</xref>). In truncation selection, a specified percentage of the population of potential behaviors is discarded, typically the least fit percentage. Parents are then chosen from the behaviors that remain. The percentage of behaviors discarded is the parameter that represents the strength of the selection event for this method. If, say, the parameter is set at 10%, then the least fit 10% of the population is discarded. As this parameter increases, parents of greater fitness will be chosen for mating, and hence fitter child behaviors will be produced. In tournament selection, a specified number of behaviors are drawn with replacement from the population of potential behaviors, and they compete on the basis of fitness to become a parent. In the deterministic version of tournament selection, the behavior with the greater, or the greatest, fitness becomes the parent. The number of behaviors that compete in the tournament is the parameter that represents the strength of the selection event for this method. The larger the number of competitors, the greater the fitness of the parents that will produce the next generation.</p>
<p align="left">A novel method of selection that is not used in typical applications of genetic algorithms is continuous selection. In this method, a fitness value is drawn at random from a continuous probability density distribution of fitness values, and then a behavior in the population with that fitness is chosen to become a parent. With this method, the probability that a behavior will become a parent is a continuous function of its fitness. The density function may have different forms, such as uniform, linear, or exponential. Suitable density functions can be written with just one parameter, which is the density function&#8217;s mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-3" rid="c70">McDowell, 2004)</xref>. This mean is the parameter that represents the strength of the selection event for the continuous fitness method. Smaller means correspond to stronger selection events, and hence yield fitter parent behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s12" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Reproduction operators</title>
<p align="left">One method of reproduction entails bitwise recombination, which was described earlier. Crossover recombination also can be used to produce child behaviors. In crossover recombination, the genotypes of the two parents are separated at one or more locations between bits, some of the father and mother pieces are crossed over to the other genotype, and the pieces are recombined to form new bit strings. The separation locations are chosen at random. This method entails an additional parameter, which is the number of locations at which the genotypes are separated. A third method of implementing reproduction is cloning. In this method, a parent chosen using one of the selection methods is cloned into the next generation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s13" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Mutation operators</title>
<p align="left">Mutation may be implemented by flipping a random bit in a percentage of individuals randomly chosen from the population (bitflip-by-individual mutation), or by specifying a probability that a bit will be flipped and then iterating through all the bits in the population to implement the mutation (bitflip-by-bit mutation). In the former method, a maximum of one bit can be flipped per individual behavior, and the mutation rate specifies the percentage of individual behaviors that will become mutants. In the latter method, any number of bits in an individual behavior, including zero, may be flipped, and the mutation rate specifies the percentage of the total bits in the population that will be flipped. A third method of implementing mutation is by randomly selecting a percentage of individual behaviors to become mutants, and then using each of these individuals&#8217; phenotype as the mean of a Gaussian distribution from which a mutant phenotype is drawn at random. This method requires an additional parameter, which is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. In this method, the mutation rate specifies the percentage of behaviors that will become mutants.</p>
<p align="left">The specifics of the selection, reproduction, and mutation operators discussed here are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-3" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Section III for reference. The Darwinian rules of selection, reproduction, and mutation operate on the population of potential behaviors. The parameters of the rules (<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-4" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Section II) are entailed by the specific operators, albeit in different ways depending on the operator.</p>

<title>Implementing the Evolutionary Theory</title>
<p align="left">To animate a virtual organism with the evolutionary theory, it is first necessary to specify the range of phenotypes for its population of potential behaviors (Section IA in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-5" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and the number of behaviors in this population (Section IC in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-6" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In all of the research discussed in the next section, the population of potential behaviors extended from phenotypes 0 through 1023, and consisted of 100 behaviors. The initial population may be generated by choosing 100 behaviors at random from the specified range, and more than one instance of a behavioral phenotype may appear in a population (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc2-4" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The next step is to decide on specific operators for the selection, reproduction, and mutation rules. In much of the research discussed in the next section, selection was implemented using a continuous linear probability density function (Section IIIA3 in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-7" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), reproduction was implemented by the bitwise method (Section IIIB1), and mutation was implemented by the bitflip-by-individual method (Section IIIC1). Finally, specific parameters for the rules must be chosen (Section II in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-8" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), for example, the mean of the linear probability density function, which establishes the strength of the selection event, might be set to 40, and the bitflip-by-individual mutation rate might be set to 10%.</p>
<p align="left">The behavior of a virtual organism animated by the evolutionary theory can be studied in any experimental environment. Consider, as an example, an environment that occasionally affords resources for behaviors emitted from a target class that extends from phenotypes 0 through 40. An experiment would begin with an emission of behavior from the initial population, as indicated near the top of <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc3-2" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. If that behavior is from the target class and results in resource acquisition or threat escape or avoidance, then the left branch of the figure is followed: One hundred pairs of parents are chosen from the population on the basis of their phenotypic similarity to the emitted behavior, using, say, a linear fitness density function with a mean of 40. If the behavior is not from the target class or is from that class but does not result in benefit to the organism, then the right branch of the figure is followed: One hundred pairs of parents are chosen at random. In either case, the parents are mated producing a new population of 100 child behaviors. This population then undergoes mutation, after which the cycle repeats, beginning with a random emission of a behavior from the new population. The emitted behaviors are recorded as they occur and can be summarized and analyzed just as if they were the behaviors of a live organism.</p>
<p align="left">Tests of the evolutionary theory entail comparing its equilibria to known behavioral steady states, and its dynamic properties to known dynamics of live-organism behavior. These tests are described in the next two sections.</p>

<title>Tests of Equilibria of the Theory</title>
<p align="left">A large body of research has produced a detailed, quantitative description of behavioral steady states in two experimental environments. One is an environment with two classes of behavior that occasionally produce resources, which is often referred to as a concurrent schedule. The other is an environment with a single class of behavior that occasionally produces resources, which is often called a single schedule. The behavior of many vertebrate species in these environments, including humans, is known to be governed by the equations of matching theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">Herrnstein, 1961</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-1" rid="c49">1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr71-1" rid="c71">McDowell, 2005)</xref>, which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-1" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. These equations are referred to by the numbers that appear in the upper left corner of each panel of the figure. The <italic>B</italic>s and <italic>r</italic>s in all panels refer to rates of behavior and resource acquisition, the numerical subscripts refer to the two components of a concurrent schedule, and the other quantities are parameters of the equations.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig4"/></p>
<p align="left">Matching theory was developed in the 1960s and 1970s to describe the behavior of animal and human subjects in laboratory experiments. Since then, the theory&#8217;s equations have been shown to describe human social behavior in natural environments, and to be relevant to human translational science and clinical application, including to the assessment and treatment of antisocial behavior, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, chronic pain syndrome, pedophilia, self-injurious behavior, and problems associated with developmental disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-1" rid="c74">McDowell, 2012</xref>). The theory accurately describes a large body of steady-state data obtained from many species in a variety of laboratory and natural environments, including human social environments. In addition, matching theory has been applied successfully to problems in other disciplines, including neoclassical microeconomics, behavioral pharmacology, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, neuroeconomics, sociology and social psychology, behavioral economics, cultural anthropology, and machine learning, artificial intelligence, artificial life, and robotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-2" rid="c74">McDowell, 2012</xref>). In summary, matching theory has become widely influential since its original statement some 50 years ago.</p>

<title>Quantitative Criterion Data From Live Organisms</title>
<p align="left">Matching theory and the evidence supporting it are reviewed in some detail in this section because tests of the evolutionary theory have followed this empirical and theoretical literature closely. To be viable, any theory of behavior dynamics must generate equilibria that are consistent with the empirically valid equations of matching theory.</p>

<title>Original matching theory</title>
<p align="left">Equation 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-2" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is the original statement of the matching law (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-2" rid="c48">Herrnstein, 1961)</xref>. It asserts that organisms distribute their behavior across concurrently available response alternatives in the same proportion that resources are distributed across them. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-2" rid="c49">Herrnstein (1970)</xref> derived Equation 2 for single-alternative environments from Equation 1 by conceptualizing a single-alternative environment as a concurrent schedule with a target behavior as one alternative and all other behavior that might be exhibited in that environment as an aggregate &#8220;extraneous&#8221; alternative. If responding occurs at a rate, <italic>B</italic>, on the target alternative and at a rate, <italic>B</italic><sub location="post"><italic>e</italic></sub>, on the extraneous alternative, and these alternatives provide resources at rates, <italic>r</italic> and <italic>r</italic><sub location="post"><italic>e</italic></sub>, then this analysis asserts that matching must hold according to Equation 1, namely,

<p align="left">According to this view, all behavior is choice, governed by the matching law. Now if the denominator on the left, <italic>B</italic> + <italic>B</italic><sub location="post"><italic>e</italic></sub>, is assumed to be constant and is set equal to <italic>k</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-3" rid="c49">Herrnstein, 1970</xref>), then the equation can be solved for <italic>B</italic>, which yields Equation 2 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-3" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Equation 2 is a rectangular hyperbola that expresses the absolute rate of a behavior as a function of the absolute rate of resource acquisition that the behavior generates. Notice that the denominator in this equation is the sum of all rates of resource acquisition from the environment.</p>
<p align="left">Equation 2 is sometimes regarded as a quantitative statement of Thorndike&#8217;s law of effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">de Villiers, 1977)</xref>. Equations 3 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-4" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are versions of Equation 2 written separately for behavior in each component of a concurrent schedule, as indicated by the numerical subscripts on the rates of behavior and resource acquisition (reinforcement). The denominators are the sums of all rates of reinforcement obtained from the environment. Equations 3 and 4 express the absolute response rate in each component of a concurrent schedule as a joint function of the reinforcement rate obtained for responding in that component, and the reinforcement rate obtained for responding in the other component. Because they are functions of two independent variables, these equations describe surfaces in a three-dimensional coordinate system. The parameters, <italic>k</italic> and <italic>r</italic><sub location="post"><italic>e</italic></sub>, in Equations 2 through 4 are theoretical quantities (as explained earlier) that are estimated by regression methods. It is important to emphasize that, according to the original interpretation of matching theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-4" rid="c49">Herrnstein, 1970</xref>), the derivation of Equations 2 through 4 requires that <italic>k</italic> remain constant across changes in reinforcement parameters other than rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1" rid="c50">Herrnstein, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-1" rid="c68">McDowell, 1986)</xref>. If this assumption does not hold, then it is not possible to obtain Equation 2 from Equation 1, and hence Equations 3 and 4 are likewise spurious.</p>

<title>Power-function matching theory</title>
<p align="left">Since 1961, many experiments have shown that Equation 1 applies to only a small subset of symmetrical choice situations. Choice is symmetrical when all properties of the concurrently available response alternatives and the resources they generate are identical for the two alternatives except for the rates of resource acquisition. It is now known that a power function version of Equation 1 is superior to the original equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr71-2" rid="c71">McDowell, 2005)</xref> and in fact, this power function version describes essentially all existing concurrent schedule data sets well. Equation 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-5" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is this more general power function form. The parameter, <italic>b</italic>, in the equation is referred to as the bias parameter, and it varies from 1 when choice is asymmetrical as, for example, when resources of different magnitudes are delivered in the two components of the concurrent schedule, or when resources in the two components differ qualitatively, or when the behaviors in the two alternatives differ. The exponent, <italic>a</italic>, varies from 1 when behavior allocation is less extreme (<italic>a</italic> &lt; 1) or more extreme (<italic>a</italic> &gt; 1) than required by the original matching equation (Equation 1). For most individual-subject data sets, the exponent, <italic>a</italic>, is found to be less than one, typically varying around a value of about 0.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Baum, 1974b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-1" rid="c69">McDowell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr85-1" rid="c85">Myers &amp; Myers, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr121-1" rid="c121">Wearden &amp; Burgess, 1982)</xref>.</p>
<p align="left">Equations 6 through 9 in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-6" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were derived from Equation 5 using the same logic that <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-5" rid="c49">Herrnstein (1970)</xref> used to derive Equation 2, and hence Equations 3 and 4, from Equation 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-2" rid="c68">McDowell, 1986)</xref>. Although notationally complicated, these equations are conceptually straightforward. Equations 6 through 9 contain bias parameters and exponents, and the theoretical parameters, <italic>k</italic> and <italic>r</italic><sub location="post"><italic>e</italic></sub>, which also appear in the original versions of the equations. Equation 6 is the single-alternative power function version of Equation 2. Equations 7 and 8 are single-alternative power function forms for each component of a concurrent schedule. They entail reinforcement rate ratios (<italic>r</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1</italic></sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2</italic></sub>, <italic>r</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1</italic></sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub location="post"><italic>e</italic></sub>, and <italic>r</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2</italic></sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub location="post"><italic>e</italic></sub>, and/or their reciprocals) and corresponding bias parameters and exponents, with each parameter subscripted to indicate the sources of reinforcement that are compared in the associated ratio. Like the original Equations 3 and 4, Equations 7 and 8 are functions of two independent variables, and consequently describe surfaces in three-dimensional coordinate systems. Equation 9 is a second matching equation that is required by the matching principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-3" rid="c68">McDowell, 1986)</xref>. When all bias parameters and exponents equal unity, Equations 5 through 8 reduce to their original forms (Equations 1 through 4), and Equation 9 reduces to Equation 1, recognizing that ratio and proportional forms are equivalent.</p>

<title>Empirical status of matching theory</title>
<p align="left">According to a recent review (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-3" rid="c74">McDowell, 2012</xref>), there is little empirical support for the original version of matching theory (left panels of <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-7" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), except for Equation 2. Regarding this equation, a large body of research shows that it describes data from single alternative environments well. But weighing against the equation are data showing that its constant-<italic>k</italic> assumption (discussed earlier) does not hold, and data showing that its power function form, Equation 6, provides a better description of data from single-alternative environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-4" rid="c74">McDowell, 2012</xref>). Two additional pieces of evidence weigh against Equation 2. The first is that there is little support for either Equation 3 or 4, both of which are forms of Equation 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-5" rid="c74">McDowell, 2012</xref>). The second is the interesting finding that the power function version of matching theory predicts that the constant-<italic>k</italic> requirement will not hold in the original version of the theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr71-3" rid="c71">McDowell, 2005)</xref>, and hence that Equations 2 through 4 cannot be obtained legitimately from Equation 1. This unexpected theoretical result, which is consistent with experimental findings, further recommends the power function version of the single alternative equation over the original version.</p>
<p align="left">In contrast to the questionable status of the original version of the theory, all available evidence indicates that the equations of the power function version of matching theory (right panels of <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-8" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) provide accurate descriptions of the behavior of animal and human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-6" rid="c74">McDowell, 2012</xref>). However, it remains the case that, given typical levels of error variance, Equation 2 also can be expected to describe behavior in single-alternative environments well, such that careful experimentation and detailed analysis are required to demonstrate the superiority of Equation 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-7" rid="c74">McDowell, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">To illustrate the power function version of matching theory, the top three panels of <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc5-1" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> show least-squares fits of Equation 5 (in logarithmic transformation) and forms of Equations 7 and 8 to the verbal behavior of antisocial boys in conversation with their peer friends in a dyadic laboratory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr78-1" rid="c78">McDowell &amp; Caron, 2010b)</xref>. Bouts of the boys&#8217; verbal behavior were coded as either &#8220;rule-break talk&#8221; or &#8220;normative talk&#8221; (<italic>B</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1</italic></sub> and <italic>B</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2</italic></sub> in the matching theory equations but labeled <italic>T</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1</italic></sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2</italic></sub> in the figure), and occasional positive social responses delivered by the peer friends for each category of the antisocial boys&#8217; talk (<italic>r</italic><sub location="post"><italic>1</italic></sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub location="post"><italic>2</italic></sub>) were recorded. The plots show that the equations described the antisocial boys&#8217; verbal behavior well; they accounted for at least 92% of the data variance in each panel. As is clear from the plots, the boys also showed a strong asymmetry in favor of normative talk. This is indicated by the negative <italic>y</italic>-intercept in the left panel, and the generally lower levels of rule-break (center panel) than normative talk (right panel).<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig5"/></p>

<title>Tests Against the Quantitative Criterion Data</title>
<p align="left">Behavior generated by the evolutionary theory has been evaluated for its conformance to matching theory in four sets of experiments. The first (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-4" rid="c70">McDowell, 2004)</xref> was conducted before the theoretical work that compared the original version of matching theory to the power function version (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr71-4" rid="c71">McDowell, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-8" rid="c74">2012</xref>) was published. Consequently, in this first set of experiments, the steady-state behavior of virtual organisms animated by the evolutionary theory was tested for its conformance to Equation 2. In addition, the robustness of the theory was evaluated with respect to different selection, reproduction, and mutation operators. And last, the necessity of implementing all three Darwinian rules was examined. The second set of experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr76-1" rid="c76">McDowell &amp; Caron, 2007)</xref> was conducted after the publication of the theoretical work on matching theory, and hence the conformance of the virtual organisms&#8217; behavior to Equation 6, the power-function version of Equation 2, was tested. In the third set of experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-1" rid="c79">McDowell, Caron, Kulubekova, &amp; Berg, 2008)</xref>, the conformance of the virtual organisms&#8217; behavior to Equation 5, the very successful power-function matching equation, was tested. And in the fourth set of experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr81-1" rid="c81">McDowell &amp; Popa, 2010)</xref> the conformance of the virtual organisms&#8217; behavior to the ensemble of Equations 1, 3, and 4, and to the ensemble of Equation 5, and forms of Equations 7 and 8, was tested. This last set of experiments constituted the most thorough and stringent quantitative test of the theory to date.</p>
<sec id="s21" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Original single-alternative form (Equation 2)</title>
<p align="left">In this series of experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-5" rid="c70">McDowell, 2004)</xref>, virtual organisms animated by the evolutionary theory were placed in environments that afforded occasional resources for behaviors emitted from a target class. Different experimental environments were arranged by arranging different rates of resource availability. The steady-state rate at which behavior was emitted from the target class and the steady-state rate of resource acquisition, which are the dependent and independent variables in Equation 2, were calculated from the recorded data. Equation 2 was fitted to these rates, and the residuals from the fits were examined for trends using a set of relatively low-power trend tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr94-1" rid="c94">Reich, 1992)</xref>.</p>
<p align="left">In these experiments, Equation 2 accounted for large proportions of variance in the response rates generated by the theory, and fits of the equation left random residuals. Hence, the specific hyperbolic form required by Equation 2, and known to characterize the behavior of live organisms in similar environments (given typical levels of error variance), was found to be an emergent equilibrium of the evolutionary theory. It is important to recognize that this hyperbolic form was not, and almost certainly could not be, built into the theory&#8217;s low-level rules. Instead, it was an emergent consequence of their combined operation.</p>
<p align="left">In these single-alternative experiments, a continuous probability density function (<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-9" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Section IIIA3) was used to choose parents for mating. Recent research (discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-1" rid="c72">McDowell, 2010)</xref> has shown that this selection operator must be used in order to obtain a hyperbolic relationship between rates of behavior and rates of resource acquisition. The other two operators listed in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-10" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (Section IIIA) generate asymptotic exponential, rather than hyperbolic, forms. This therefore appears to be a boundary condition of the evolutionary theory. Selection must be implemented by a continuous probability density function. This conclusion is further supported by unpublished experiments conducted by the author and, independently, by Nicolas Raillard (personal communication, March 26, 2011), which showed that two other selection operators frequently used in genetic algorithms, namely, fitness proportionate selection and an extension of this method known as stochastic universal sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-4" rid="c43">Goldberg, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr96-2" rid="c96">S. Russell &amp; Norvig, 2003</xref>), also produced asymptotic exponential forms relating the rate of behavior to the rate of resource acquisition.</p>
<p align="left">Although a continuous probability density function must be used as the selection operator in the evolutionary theory, the theory appears to be robust with respect to the specific form of this function. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-6" rid="c70">McDowell (2004)</xref> tested exponential, linear, and uniform probability density functions and found that all produced hyperbolic relations between the rate of emission of a target behavior and the rate of resource acquisition. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-7" rid="c70">McDowell (2004)</xref> also studied the first two reproduction operators listed in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-11" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (Sections IIIB1 and IIIB2) and all three mutation operators (<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-12" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Section IIIC). He found that the theory was robust with respect to the specifics of these operators; in all cases the required hyperbolic relation between the rate of emission of a target behavior and the rate of resource acquisition was found. Regarding cloning, subsequent research (discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-2" rid="c72">McDowell, 2010)</xref> indicates that reproduction by cloning greatly reduces the extent of the theory&#8217;s agreement with data from live organisms. Hence, the method of reproduction may entail a second boundary condition of the theory, namely, that reproduction must be implemented by a form of bit string recombination, although the specifics of this recombination (e.g., bitwise vs. crossover) are not critical, at least for the hyperbolic form of the response rate versus reinforcement rate relation.</p>
<p align="left">A first glance at the parameters and operator specifics of the Darwinian rules listed in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-13" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (Sections II and III) suggests that the theory has many degrees of freedom, perhaps too many to render the theory easily falsifiable. But the research reviewed so far shows that this is not the case. Evidently, the theory must be implemented with a selection method that entails a continuous probability density function, and with a reproduction method that entails bit string recombination, but otherwise the theory is not materially affected by operator specifics. This means, for example, that the theory cannot be made to correspond to specific findings from live organisms by implementing different operators. Effectively, for a given population of potential behaviors in a single-alternative environment, the theory has only two free parameters. These are the mean of the continuous density function (which represents the strength of the selection event), and the mutation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-14" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Section II).</p>
<p align="left">The mean of the continuous density function can be understood to represent properties of the resource that is acquired, such as its magnitude or value to the organism, as well as properties of the target behavior, such as its effortfulness or cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-8" rid="c70">McDowell, 2004)</xref>. This interpretation is supported by research that is discussed later (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-2" rid="c79">McDowell et al., 2008)</xref>. Mutation rate, on the other hand, may best be considered a property of the organism that reflects a specific balance between perseverative and impulsive behavior. This interpretation is based on the finding that at low mutation rates behavior generated by the theory tends to remain in its current class regardless of the properties of, or changes in, the availability of resources, while at high mutation rates behavior tends to switch out of its current class, also regardless of environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-3" rid="c79">McDowell et al., 2008)</xref>.</p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-9" rid="c70">McDowell (2004)</xref> studied the effects of the two parameters of the Darwinian rules (<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-15" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Section II) by varying the mean of the density function and the rate of mutation, resulting in 30 combinations of density function mean and mutation rate. These experiments yielded two main findings. First, for all combinations of parameter values, hyperbolic forms (Equation 2) accurately described the relationship between the virtual organisms&#8217; rate of response and the rate of resource acquisition, and fits of the hyperbola left random residuals, according to the <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr94-2" rid="c94">Reich (1992)</xref> tests. The second main finding was that <italic>k</italic>, the <italic>y</italic>-asymptote of Equation 2, varied with the mean of the density function, such that larger <italic>k</italic>s were obtained for smaller density function means. Hence, as benefit increased with respect to cost (i.e., the density function mean decreased), as would be the case for resources with larger magnitudes, <italic>k</italic> increased. In other words, data generated by the evolutionary theory violated the constant-<italic>k</italic> assumption of matching theory in the same way that the behavior of live organisms does (noted earlier). These experiments also showed, not surprisingly, that mutation tended to dilute the effects of selection, and consequently, that higher rates of mutation produced lower rates of target behavior emission, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>.</p>

In addition, at moderate mutation rates (3% to 20%), exponents estimated from fits of Equation 6 varied around 0.8, as has been found in experiments with live organisms. Residuals from the fits of Equations 2 and 6 were tested for linear, quadratic, and cubic polynomial trends, which is a more powerful method of trend testing than the <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr94-3" rid="c94">Reich (1992)</xref> method used by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-11" rid="c70">McDowell (2004)</xref>. The majority of the fits of Equation 2 (24 of 30), but only two of the fits of Equation 6, yielded nonrandom residuals.

<title>Power function concurrent form (Equation 5)</title>
<p align="left">Equation 5, the power-function matching equation, or generalized matching law, is by far the most widely studied equation of matching theory. It is also the most important equation of the theory because it, along with its now-abandoned original version, Equation 1, are the foundational equations from which the other equations of the theory are derived. As noted earlier, Equation 5 accurately describes essentially all existing concurrent schedule data obtained from many vertebrate species, including humans, in a wide variety of experimental, naturalistic, natural, and social environments. It is widely accepted as a correct and accurate description of continuous choice.</p>
<p align="left">To test the conformance of behavior generated by the evolutionary theory to Equation 5, virtual organisms animated by the theory were studied in a variety of multialternative environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-4" rid="c79">McDowell et al., 2008)</xref>. The means of the probability density functions in each component of the concurrent schedules were varied, both symmetrically and asymmetrically, and the mutation rates applied to the populations of potential behaviors were also varied. The main finding from these experiments was that Equation 5 provided an excellent description of the behavior generated by the evolutionary theory in all experimental conditions. In addition, asymmetries in the density function means across the two components produced biased responding (<italic>b</italic> &#8800; 1) that was orderly, and consistent with the biased responding observed in live organisms. As suggested earlier, this finding supports the conjecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-12" rid="c70">McDowell, 2004)</xref> that the density function mean is a cost/benefit ratio that reflects, among other things, the magnitude of the resource being acquired.</p>
<p align="left">A second important finding from these experiments was that, over a range of moderate mutation rates, the exponent obtained from fits of Equation 5 varied around a value of about 0.8, just as was found for fits of Equation 6 to data generated by the evolutionary theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr76-3" rid="c76">McDowell &amp; Caron, 2007)</xref>. The correspondence of this specific value to values obtained from experiments with live organisms is especially noteworthy. The simple rules of the evolutionary theory do not, and surely could not, predetermine this numeric value. Evidently, like the forms of the functions themselves, this value is an emergent property of the joint operation of the theory&#8217;s rules.</p>

<title>Original versus power function matching theory</title>
<p align="left">The research reviewed so far shows that the evolutionary theory generates behavior in single- and multialternative environments that is described by Equations 2, 6, and 5 of matching theory in the same way that the behavior of live organisms is described by these equations. This agreement with data from live organisms includes two important details, namely, the constant-<italic>k</italic> requirement of the original theory does not hold for data generated by the evolutionary theory, and at moderate mutation rates, the exponent that appears in Equations 5 and 6 varies around a value of about 0.8.</p>
<p align="left">Every concurrent schedule experiment affords a complete and stringent test of both forms of matching theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr71-6" rid="c71">McDowell, 2005)</xref>. This test is conducted by fitting Equations 1, 3, and 4 of the original version of the theory as an ensemble with shared parameters, and by fitting Equations 5, 7, and 8 of the power function version of the theory as an ensemble with shared parameters.</p>
<p align="left">Ensemble fits to data (reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-5" rid="c79">McDowell et al., 2008)</xref> generated by the evolutionary theory, and to an extended set of data generated by the theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr81-2" rid="c81">McDowell &amp; Popa, 2010)</xref>, showed that the power function version of matching theory, but not the original version, accurately described the behavior of virtual organisms animated by the evolutionary theory, leaving random residuals in all cases. In addition, exponents obtained from the fits of the power function version varied around 0.8 at moderate mutation rates, and bias parameters behaved as would be expected on the basis of power-function matching theory, and data from live organisms. The bottom three panels of <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc5-2" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> show plots of an ensemble fit to one of <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr81-3" rid="c81">McDowell and Popa&#8217;s (2010)</xref> extended data sets (density function means of 40 in both components). As was the case in <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr78-2" rid="c78">McDowell and Caron&#8217;s (2010b)</xref> analysis of the verbal behavior of antisocial boys (shown in the top panels of the figure) these fits entailed shared parameters that were estimated simultaneously from the three sources of variance. It is clear from the figure that power function matching theory provided an excellent description of the equilibria generated by the evolutionary theory. The equations accounted for 98% of the data variance in each panel, and the fits left random residuals in all cases. Note that McDowell and Popa arranged symmetrical concurrent schedules (identical density function means in both components) in their experiments, which produced unbiased responding (<italic>b</italic> = 1). This is indicated by the zero <italic>y</italic>-intercept in the bottom left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc5-3" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and by the similar rates of responding in the two components of the schedules, which is evident in the bottom center and right panels of the figure.</p>

<title>Other Tests of the Theory</title>
<p align="left">In concurrent schedules that were used to test the evolutionary theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-6" rid="c79">McDowell et al., 2008)</xref>, the two target classes of behavior were positioned such that the highest phenotype of one class was 511, and the lowest phenotype of the other was 512. As noted earlier, the Hamming distance between the genotypes that correspond to these phenotypes is 10 when each is expressed as a 10-bit string. This means that all 10 bits must be flipped to turn one of these phenotypes into the other. A large Hamming distance at the class boundary makes it relatively difficult for phenotypes to switch from one target class to the other. This produces relatively sustained bouts of responding on each of the two alternatives, an effect that is similar to the effect produced by a change-over delay (COD) in experiments with live organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Findley, 1958)</xref>. A change-over delay is an interval of time that must elapse after switching to a new alternative before a resource can be acquired from that alternative. Research discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr91-1" rid="c91">Popa and McDowell (2010)</xref> has shown that when the target classes are positioned so that smaller Hamming distances lie at their boundary, the rate of switching between the target classes increases, and the exponent obtained from fits of power function matching (Equation 5) decreases. Increased rates of switching and lower exponents also are found in experiments with live organisms when the COD is decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr103-1" rid="c103">Shull &amp; Pliskoff, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr115-1" rid="c115">Temple, Scown, &amp; Foster, 1995)</xref>. Hence, as <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-7" rid="c79">McDowell et al. (2008)</xref> speculated, the Hamming distance between target classes in the evolutionary theory is analogous to the COD in experiments with live organisms. Additional experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr91-2" rid="c91">Popa &amp; McDowell, 2010)</xref> have shown that a minimal Hamming distance, which depends on the size of the target classes, is required to obtain appropriate exponents (&#8773; 0.8) from fits of Equation 5, but that increasing the Hamming distance beyond this minimal value has no additional effect on the exponents. On the other hand, when the Hamming distance is decreased below this value, the exponent decreases rapidly and stabilizes at a value that reflects near indifference (exponent near zero). This same pattern of exponents as a function of the COD has been reported in experiments with live organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr103-2" rid="c103">Shull &amp; Pliskoff, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr115-2" rid="c115">Temple et al., 1995)</xref>.</p>
<p align="left">Patterns of changeovers in the behavior generated by the evolutionary theory have also been studied. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-8" rid="c79">McDowell et al.

This same pattern of changeovers has been reported in experiments with live organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Alsop &amp; Elliffe, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">Baum, 1974a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">Brownstein &amp; Pliskoff, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-3" rid="c48">Herrnstein, 1961)</xref>.</p>

<title>Summary of Tests of Equilibria</title>
<p align="left">The evidence reviewed in the previous sections showed that the empirically valid equations of matching theory are emergent equilibria of the evolutionary theory. Importantly, the evidence also showed that the equations of matching theory that are known to be false, that is, the equations that fail to accurately describe the behavior of live organisms (e.g., Equations 3 and 4), also failed to accurately describe behavior generated by the evolutionary theory.</p>
<p align="left">In addition to the general function forms required by matching theory, the evolutionary theory generates two important parametric details that are consistent with findings from live organisms. These are the violation of the constant-<italic>k</italic> assumption that is required to derive Equation 2, and the value of about 0.8 for the power-function matching exponent. The latter detail is especially noteworthy because it is a specific numeric value that emerges from the combined operation of the theory&#8217;s low-level Darwinian rules.</p>
<p align="left">The evolutionary theory was also tested in a more complicated environment where both the rate and magnitude of resources were varied. Behavior generated by the theory in this environment was quantitatively indistinguishable from the behavior of live organisms, and the theory generated a specific numeric value for the magnitude-ratio exponent in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" id="eqnc1-3" rid="eqn1">Equation 10</xref> that was essentially identical to the value obtained in experiments with live organisms.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, two additional properties of behavior generated by the evolutionary theory were shown to be consistent with live-organism behavior. These were the responsivity of behavior allocation, and of the exponent in Equation 5, to variations in the changeover delay, and the patterns of changeovers in concurrent schedules.</p>

<title>Tests of Dynamics of the Theory</title>
<p align="left">The dynamics of the evolutionary theory have been tested by studying acquisition, extinction, and the instantaneous dynamics of behavior generated by the theory, and by studying patterns of preference change that the theory generates when resource allocation changes rapidly.</p>
<sec id="s29" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Acquisition, Extinction, and Instantaneous Dynamics</title>
<p align="left">Acquisition, extinction, and instantaneous dynamics are often studied by examining graphical representations of behavior called cumulative records. These are plots of the cumulative number of emissions from a target class as a function of time.</p>
<p align="left">Virtual organisms animated by the evolutionary theory acquire instrumental behavior rapidly. After just a few resources have been obtained (sometimes only one) the target behavior increases abruptly to a relatively high rate. When resources are subsequently removed, that is, when extinction is arranged, the rate of the target behavior declines fairly gradually, sometimes over many generations or time ticks. The pattern of the decline is usually irregular and often exhibits features such as ringing, which consists of repeated bursts of responding followed by relatively low rates of behavior. These same dynamic features have been observed in the behavior of rats during acquisition and extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr104-1" rid="c104">Skinner, 1938)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr104-2" rid="c104">Skinner&#8217;s (1938)</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc3-3" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-9" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc5-4" rid="fig5">5</xref> show examples of the rapid acquisition of instrumental behavior by individual rats; he concluded that &#8220;a practically complete instantaneous change [in rate] is extremely common &#8230; [in] original conditioning (p. 71).&#8221; Skinner&#8217;s <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc7-1" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows examples of the relatively gradual and irregular course of extinction, including forms of ringing, which he referred to as instances of deviation (periods of low rate) with compensation (followed by bursts of responding).<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig7"/></p>
<p align="left">The instantaneous slopes of cumulative records reflect the momentary rates of emission of behavior from a target class. In a relatively constant environment it is possible to obtain similar overall average rates of responding, and hence similar overall steady-state behavior, with different instantaneous dynamics. For example, cumulative records characterized by long pauses interspersed with periods of high-rate responding could produce the same overall average response rate as cumulative records that appear wavy because of continuously changing instantaneous slopes. It is well known from laboratory studies with many species, including humans, that when resources are made available at unpredictable times, cumulative records of behavior are characterized by roughly constant instantaneous slopes with occasional irregularities, such as brief periods of pausing, response acceleration, and response deceleration. Many cumulative records have been examined for behavior generated by the evolutionary theory when resources were made available at unpredictable times; all were characterized by roughly constant instantaneous slopes with these occasional irregularities.</p>
<p align="left">Another way to study instantaneous dynamics is to examine distributions of times between responses, which are often referred to as interresponse time (IRT) distributions. In the case of live-organism behavior, these distributions take on a variety of forms that reflect different patterns of momentary responding. For example, behavior may occur in bouts of rapid responding that are separated by relatively long pauses, in which case the IRT distribution will consist of many small intervals and a few long ones. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-1" rid="c62">Kulubekova and McDowell (2008)</xref> examined IRT distributions for data generated by the evolutionary theory and found distribution forms that were comparable to those obtained from live organisms when the cost of responding is low. At higher costs of responding, the forms of the distributions for live organisms may change to reflect bout-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr101-1" rid="c101">Shull, Gaynor, &amp; Grimes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr102-1" rid="c102">Shull &amp; Grimes, 2003)</xref>. Higher response-cost conditions were not studied by Kulubekova and McDowell, but as suggested earlier, they can be arranged by increasing the mean of the continuous fitness density function.</p>
<p align="left">In summary, acquisition, extinction, and the instantaneous dynamics of behavior generated by the evolutionary theory are indistinguishable from these phenomena in live-organism behavior.</p>

<title>Preference Change in Rapidly Changing Environments</title>
<p align="left">Davison and Baum and their colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Davison &amp; Baum, 2000)</xref> have studied changing behavior allocations and patterns of preference change in environments that arrange series of different unsignaled concurrent-schedule reinforcement rate ratios in individual sessions. In the basic experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-2" rid="c21">Davison and Baum (2000)</xref> arranged seven concurrent schedules in each session. The schedules were arranged in a different irregular order in each session, lasted until a small fixed number of reinforcers was obtained, were not correlated with any external stimulus, and were separated from each other by short blackout periods. The ratios of probabilities of reinforcement in the two components of each schedule were 27:1, 9:1, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, 1:9 and 1:27 for the seven schedules. Davison and Baum studied the development of and change in preference over the fixed number of reinforcers delivered in each schedule.</p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-1" rid="c63">Kulubekova and McDowell (2013)</xref> replicated <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-3" rid="c21">Davison and Baum&#8217;s (2000)</xref> experiment using virtual organisms animated by the evolutionary theory. They arranged Davison and Baum&#8217;s seven concurrent schedules, presented them in different irregular orders in each session, kept each schedule in effect until 10 reinforcers were obtained, and did not provide external stimuli that might affect behavior. <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc6-1" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows the development of preference, expressed as the logarithm of the ratio of response rates in the two components, in the seven concurrent schedules as a function of the successive reinforcers obtained while the schedule was in effect. <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc6-2" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> shows the results for a representative bird (Bird 91) from Davison and Baum&#8217;s experiment; <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc6-3" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> shows Kulubekova and McDowell&#8217;s results using the evolutionary theory. In both cases, and for all schedules, preference was near indifference (log response ratio = 0) before the first reinforcer (0 on the <italic>x</italic>-axis). Preference for the richer component increased as successive reinforcers were obtained, and quickly&#8212;indeed, after as few as two reinforcers&#8212;reached a roughly asymptotic value. As shown in the figure, the asymptotes departed more from zero, that is, reflected greater preference, the greater the discrepancy between the probabilities of reinforcement in the two components. Davison and Baum and Kulubekova and McDowell also fitted the power-function matching equation, Equation 5, to data up to the first reinforcer delivery, to data up to the second reinforcer delivery, and so on, and found for both the live birds and the virtual organism, that the exponent, <italic>a</italic>, of the equation was near zero (reflecting indifference) before the first reinforcer, increased with subsequent reinforcers, and reached an asymptotic value characteristic of steady-state performance after just a few reinforcers. These results show that behavior generated by the evolutionary theory changes rapidly with changing environmental conditions and that these changes are indistinguishable from those observed in the behavior of live organisms.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig6"/></p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-4" rid="c21">Davison and Baum (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-2" rid="c63">Kulubekova and McDowell (2013)</xref> also studied smaller scale dynamics in these rapidly changing concurrent schedules by aggregating data within each interval between successive reinforcers, which is called an interreinforcement interval (IRI). They then studied changes in preference from one IRI to the next. Note that successive reinforcers may come from either component (which can be designated left or right) of the schedule. Davison and Baum and Kulubekova and McDowell considered the first three reinforcers obtained in a concurrent schedule, for which eight possible left/right sequences may be observed. Preferences within IRIs for these eight sequences are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc7-2" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> as a function of the successive reinforcers. The left panels show preferences averaged across Davison and Baum&#8217;s birds. The right panels show preferences of a virtual organism animated by the evolutionary theory. The top panels show data from a relatively low overall reinforcement rate condition; the bottom panels show data from a relatively high overall reinforcement rate condition. Each data point represents the preference within the IRI that begins with the reinforcer identified by that data point&#8217;s <italic>x</italic>-coordinate. Consider, for example, the left-right-right sequences (unfilled-filled-filled circles) in the four panels. Before the first reinforcer (<italic>x</italic>-coordinate = 0), both the birds and the virtual organism were indifferent to the two alternatives (log response ratio = 0). After the first reinforcer but before the second (<italic>x</italic>-coordinate = 1), the birds&#8217; and the virtual organism&#8217;s preference increased for the left alternative (unfilled circle), which delivered the first reinforcer. After the second reinforcer but before the third, the birds&#8217; and the virtual organism&#8217;s preference shifted abruptly to the right alternative (filled circle), which delivered the second reinforcer. After the third reinforcer but before the fourth, the birds&#8217; and the virtual organism&#8217;s preference increased for the right alternative (i.e., became more negative in this logarithmic representation), which delivered the third reinforcer.</p>
<p align="left">Overall, <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc7-3" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows, for both the birds and the virtual organism, that preference within the IRIs increased with successive reinforcers obtained from the same alternative and that the rate of increase slowed as more reinforcers were obtained. However, when a reinforcer from one alternative was followed by a reinforcer from the other alternative, both the birds&#8217; and the virtual organism&#8217;s preference in the subsequent IRI shifted abruptly in favor of the other alternative. <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc7-4" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> also shows that for both the birds and the virtual organism, the changes in preference were greater when the overall reinforcement rate was relatively high (bottom panels of the figure) than when it was relatively low (top panels). This is reflected in the wider vertical spread of the preference plots in the bottom than in the top panels.</p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-3" rid="c63">Kulubekova and McDowell&#8217;s (2013)</xref> results show that the dynamic properties of behavior generated by the evolutionary theory in the rapidly changing environments studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-5" rid="c21">Davison and Baum (2000)</xref>, are indistinguishable from those of live-organism behavior in essentially every detail.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p align="left">The research reviewed in the previous two sections provides strong support for the evolutionary theory, which asserts that the world of behavior we observe and measure is generated by evolutionary dynamics. Every test of the theory to date has produced results that are consistent with both steady-state and dynamic features of live-organism behavior. Moreover, in no case was it necessary to tune the theory by using different selection, reproduction, or mutation operators, or different parameter values, to obtain these results.</p>
<p align="left">It is especially significant that the theory generates equilibria that are accurately described by the empirically valid equations of matching theory. This is important because the matching theory equations are known to describe the behavior of many vertebrate species, including humans, in a wide range of experimental, naturalistic, natural, and social environments. Because the theory generates these equilibria, it constitutes a dynamic account of this large body of data.</p>
<p align="left">As noted earlier, research has revealed boundary conditions and a number of robust features of the theory and has led to specific interpretations of some of the theory&#8217;s elements. Specifically, the theory must be implemented with a continuous probability-density selection operator (<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-16" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Section IIIA3) and (probably) a reproduction operator that entails recombination, but it is robust with respect to other details of the operators, which is to say that it gives the same results regardless of those details. Consequently, the theory entails just two parameters that materially affect the behavior it generates. These are the mean of the density function used to choose parents for mating, and the mutation rate. The former has been interpreted as a cost/benefit ratio that applies to the behavior/resource combination under study; research reviewed earlier showed that this interpretation is reasonable. Mutation rate has been interpreted as an organismic property related to behavioral perseveration/impulsivity. It is also important to note that all three Darwinian rules (<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-17" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Section III) must operate in order for the theory to function properly. This is obvious for selection and reproduction, but <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-13" rid="c70">McDowell (2004)</xref> found that mutation was also necessary. He reported that without mutation, behavior becomes maladaptively perseverative, that is, it gets stuck in an arbitrary class and becomes unresponsive to environmental resources and to changes in their availability.</p>

Hence, a material mechanism for the evolutionary theory may be the selectionist operation of the nervous system. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr92-2" rid="c92">Pringle (1951)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-2" rid="c46">Hayek (1952b)</xref>, and most recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Edelman (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-2" rid="c29">1987</xref>) have proposed selectionist theories of brain functioning. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-3" rid="c72">McDowell (2010)</xref> discussed Edelman&#8217;s theory and its relation to the evolutionary theory of adaptive behavior dynamics in detail. Integer phenotypes in the evolutionary theory correspond to behaviors while bit-string genotypes correspond to patterns of neural activation. Edelman and his colleagues have implemented the selectionist theory by means of artificial neural networks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Edelman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr117-1" rid="c117">Tononi, Sporns, &amp; Edelman, 1992)</xref> that give the appearance of functioning like material nervous systems in some ways. However, as various authors have pointed out (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-1" rid="c58">Kehoe, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr65-1" rid="c65">Marr, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-1" rid="c66">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr75-1" rid="c75">McDowell, in press</xref>), real nervous systems are far more complicated than any artificial neural network. Consequently, neural network theories may best be considered functional theories, like the evolutionary theory, rather than representations of the operation of actual nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr75-2" rid="c75">McDowell, in press</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">As suggested earlier, a good functional theory can be said to be computationally equivalent to the operation of the nervous system. This means that if the output of a functional theory agrees with experimental measurements, then the computations the theory&#8217;s algorithmic operations carry out must be equivalent to <italic>emergent</italic> computations carried out by the normal functioning of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr75-3" rid="c75">McDowell, in press</xref>). An emergent computation is one that is not specifically built into a system as part of its functioning but is nevertheless carried out by the system&#8217;s overall operation. As an example of an emergent computation, consider a person counting 15 beans into each of three jars, then pouring all the beans out onto a table and counting them, giving the result of 45 (analogous to examples in <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Feynman, 1985/2006)</xref>. This is a straightforward set of physical actions that consist entirely of counting and manipulating beans and jars, but notice that it also carries out the multiplication, 3 &#215; 15. This multiplication is an emergent computation that is the result of the physical system&#8217;s operation. Analogously, the normal physical operation of the nervous system may generate processes of neural circuit selection, reproduction, and mutation as emergent outcomes. These processes need not be built into the nervous system specifically; instead, they may be emergent consequences of its overall operation.</p>

<title>Further Development of the Theory</title>
<p align="left">Further development of the evolutionary theory may proceed in many directions, three of which are discussed briefly here.</p>
<sec id="s34" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Responsivity to aversive stimulation</title>
<p align="left">It is important to incorporate responsivity to aversive stimulation into the theory. Punishment of behavior with an aversive stimulus can be added by using a fitness density function in the selection operator that identifies the punished behavior as the least fit behavior (as opposed to identifying a behavior that produces a resource as the most fit behavior). Behavior generated by the theory using this fitness density function can then be compared to quantitative findings from experiments that arrange punishment for behavior in single-alternative environments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">Bradshaw, Szabadi, &amp; Bevan, 1978)</xref>, and to theoretical predictions about and quantitative findings from experiments that arrange punishment for behavior in multialternative environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Deluty, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">de Villiers, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Farley, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">1980</xref>). In many experiments with punishment, both reinforcers and punishers are arranged for target behaviors, and one or the other, or both simultaneously, are made contingent on behavior. Simultaneous delivery of reinforcers and punishers can also be arranged for virtual organisms animated by the evolutionary theory. Interestingly, escape and avoidance behavior are enabled automatically by a fitness density function that identifies a punished behavior as the least fit behavior. Consider, for example, an aversive stimulus that is continuously present except for a period of time after a target behavior is emitted. Under such conditions all behaviors except those in the target class will be punished, which will drive phenotypes in the population of potential behaviors away from all values except those and will therefore cause the phenotypes in the population to congregate in and near the target class. Whether the resulting escape behavior will have the same quantitative and qualitative properties as live organism escape behavior is of course a matter for experimental test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s35" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Discriminative control</title>
<p align="left">A second important theoretical development entails incorporating discriminative control into the theory so that behavior can become contextual. A method for accomplishing this has already been worked out (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr83-1" rid="c83">McDowell, Soto, Dallery, &amp; Kulubekova, 2006)</xref>. It entails <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-1" rid="c67">Mazur&#8217;s (1997)</xref> hyperbolic delay theory of conditioned reinforcement and the Rescorla-Wagner theory of associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Danks, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr114-1" rid="c114">Sutton &amp; Barto, 1998)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr83-2" rid="c83">McDowell et al. (2006)</xref> linked these theories in such a way that discriminative stimuli may acquire value by means of their association with resources. In addition, they assigned to each discriminative stimulus a separate population of behaviors that becomes active when that stimulus is present. Hence, different patterns of behavior can develop in the presence of different discriminative stimuli, and virtual organisms animated by the theory can work to change contexts, for example, from less favorable to more favorable ones. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Berg (2011)</xref> implemented a version of this method and obtained good discriminative responding; he also found that virtual organisms worked to change contexts in the same way that live organisms do. However, Berg&#8217;s implementation entails two parameters that both represent the magnitude of environmental resources. This redundancy is theoretically inelegant and introduces practical uncertainties when working with Berg&#8217;s implementation. In spite of these problems, Berg&#8217;s findings indicate that some form of McDowell et al.&#8217;s method is likely to be successful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s36" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Social interaction</title>
<p align="left">Once sensitivity to aversive stimulation and discriminative control are incorporated into the evolutionary theory, it will be possible to arrange and study social interactions among virtual organisms animated by the theory, beginning with the simplest case of dyadic interaction. The appetitive (approach), escape, and avoidance behavior of each virtual organism in a dyad can come under the control of discriminative stimuli constituted by the other virtual organism&#8217;s behavior. An organism&#8217;s behaviors may also constitute social resources and/or aversive stimuli for its dyadic partner. Hence, social interactions between organisms can develop and be maintained, and the quantitative details of these interactions can be compared to existing data from live subjects. A good source of live-subject data is the observational research of Gerald Patterson and his colleagues, who have studied the interaction of antisocial children with their parents, teachers, and peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr77-1" rid="c77">McDowell &amp; Caron, 2010a)</xref>. These researchers have found, among other things, that antisocial children&#8217;s aggressive behavior often escapes aversive stimulation by terminating efforts by others to control the antisocial child&#8217;s behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr89-1" rid="c89">Patterson, 1982)</xref>. As a specific example, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr110-1" rid="c110">Snyder and Patterson (1995)</xref> collected a set of observational data from mothers interacting with their aggressive sons, which included detailed quantitative information such as conditional probabilities of mothers terminating demands (e.g., &#8220;pick up your toys&#8221; or &#8220;keep your voice down&#8221;) given aggressive verbal or nonverbal responses from their sons (e.g., throwing the toy or cursing at the mother). Virtual mothers and their aggressive sons can be implemented in various ways. For example, the fitness density function means associated with social resources and aversive stimuli can be set to specific values, or the virtual sons&#8217; populations of potential behaviors could be preloaded with many phenotypes corresponding to aggressive behaviors. The virtual mothers and sons would then interact with each other, and quantitative details of their behavior could be compared to Snyder and Patterson&#8217;s data. Interestingly, if Snyder and Patterson&#8217;s data set can be replicated in experiments with virtual organisms animated by the evolutionary theory, then it should be possible to test treatment interventions in these virtual environments. For example, the virtual mothers could be &#8220;instructed,&#8221; again by means of phenotype preloading, to behave in different ways, and the resulting behavior of their sons could be observed.</p>
<p align="left">This method of generating social interactions is similar to agent-based modeling that has been studied by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr84-2" rid="c84">Miller &amp; Page, 2007)</xref>. However, in most of these implementations, the properties of, and the operational rules typically followed by, the agents are arbitrary. An advantage of using the evolutionary theory as the animating principle for virtual agents is that the behavior it generates has a demonstrated degree of quantitative and qualitative similarity to live organism behavior.</p>

<title>Other Theories of Behavior Dynamics</title>
<p align="left">Many theories of behavior dynamics have been proposed, and the literature describing, debating, and testing them is extensive. Some dynamic theories are based on statements of principles, like melioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">Herrnstein, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr118-1" rid="c118">Vaughan, 1981)</xref>; some are based on differential equations or other analytic mathematical statements, like various maximization and optimality theories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Baum, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr93-1" rid="c93">Rachlin, Battalio, Kagel, &amp; Green, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr99-1" rid="c99">Shimp, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr112-1" rid="c112">Staddon, Hinson, &amp; Kram, 1981)</xref>, a kinetic theory of choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr86-1" rid="c86">Myerson &amp; Miezin, 1980)</xref>, a component-functions model (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr87-1" rid="c87">Navakatikyan &amp; Davison, 2010)</xref>, and a mechanistic linear filter theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Corrado, Sugrue, Seung, &amp; Newsome, 2005)</xref>; some are based on artificial neural networks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-2" rid="c26">Donahoe et al., 1993)</xref>; some are based on the idea that acquired resources add to a reserve of behavior that is discharged over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Catania, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-1" rid="c59">Killeen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr104-3" rid="c104">Skinner, 1938)</xref>; some are based on cognitive or decision-theoretic principles (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Gallistel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr100-1" rid="c100">Shimp, Childers, &amp; Hightower, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Dragoi &amp; Staddon, 1999)</xref>; and some are based on analogies with classical physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr60-1" rid="c60">Killeen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-1" rid="c64">Marr, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr88-1" rid="c88">Nevin, 1992)</xref>. Many theories of behavior dynamics attempt to generate equilibria and other behavioral phenomena <italic>de novo</italic>, but some seek only to describe trajectories to equilibria that are known in advance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr87-2" rid="c87">Navakatikyan &amp; Davison, 2010)</xref>. Many theories produce behavioral equilibria and other behavioral phenomena by direct calculation, such as melioration theory, most maximization and optimality theories, the kinetic theory, and the component-functions model. But some theories produce equilibria and other behavioral phenomena by repeatedly applying rules, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-2" rid="c17">Catania&#8217;s (2005)</xref> version of behavior reserve theory, most neural network theories, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr99-2" rid="c99">Shimp&#8217;s (1966)</xref> momentary maximizing theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-2" rid="c19">Corrado, et al.&#8217;s (2005)</xref> mechanistic linear filter theory, and some cognitive theories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-2" rid="c27">Dragoi &amp; Staddon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr100-2" rid="c100">Shimp et al., 1990)</xref>.</p>
<p align="left">One difficulty in comparing theories of behavior dynamics is that there is no body of data that researchers have agreed must be accounted for in order to establish a theory as a serious candidate. Additionally, there is no agreed upon prioritization of additional data sets that must be accounted for by a candidate theory. Theorists typically state a theory and then choose various behavioral phenomena to show that it accounts for data. Some of these phenomena are fairly esoteric, and might be considered laboratory curiosities. Ultimately of course, such phenomena must be accounted for by a good theory, but it seems reasonable to first test a candidate theory against phenomena that are widely observed in many environments and that have well-established quantitative properties. Using widely observed findings as criteria ensures that a candidate theory will apply to a large body of data. Requiring that criterion phenomena have known quantitative properties ensures that the test of a candidate theory will be stringent, inasmuch as the theory must accurately reproduce the quantitative properties. One reasonable initial criterion against which to test a dynamic theory is the set of steady states described by the empirically valid equations of matching theory, which are both widely observed and quantitatively detailed. It is worth noting that a number of dynamic theories can generate some of the equilibria described by the empirically valid equations of matching theory. However, none except for the evolutionary theory has been shown to generate all of the equilibria described by these equations, right down to their parametric details.</p>
<p align="left">Although the initial statements of theories of behavior dynamics are usually accompanied by some supporting evidence, there is counterevidence for, and/or arguments against, most theories including melioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr122-1" rid="c122">Williams &amp; Royalty, 1989)</xref>, various forms of maximization (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr124-1" rid="c124">Prelec, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr118-2" rid="c118">Vaughan, 1981)</xref>, some neural network theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Calvin, 2012)</xref>, and behavior reserve theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Berg &amp; McDowell, 2011)</xref>. Again, however, it is not always clear how to judge the importance of this counterevidence because there are no agreed-upon and prioritized data sets that are considered important for theories to be able to deal with effectively.</p>
<p align="left">A second difficulty in comparing theories of behavior dynamics is theoretical bias for one or another type of theory. For example, theoreticians with a neuroscience bias may feel that a good dynamic theory must be stated in a form that can be compared directly to nervous system functioning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-3" rid="c26">Donahoe et al., 1993)</xref>. Theoreticians with a cognitive or decision-theoretic bias may feel that a good theory must be stated in the form of cognitive principles and operations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">Gallistel, 1990)</xref>. Theoreticians with an economic or optimal foraging theory bias may feel that a good theory must entail the maximization of utility. These biases arise from first principles that are usually taken as true <italic>sola fide</italic>: Behavior arises from brain function, organisms make decisions, animals and humans maximize benefit. To the theoretician, a favored first principle may lend legitimacy to a theory to such an extent that theories based on other first principles may seem undesirable, or even false <italic>a limine</italic>. Richard Feynman considered a similar state of affairs in twentieth-century physics in the context of discussing his path integral formulation of quantum mechanics: 
<disp-quote>
<p align="left">[physicists have] learned to realize that whether they like a theory or they don&#8217;t like a theory is <italic>not</italic> the essential question. Rather, it is whether the theory gives predictions that agree with experiment. It is not a question of whether a theory is philosophically delightful &#8230; or perfectly reasonable from the point of view of common sense. The [path integral formalism is] absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it agrees fully with experiment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-2" rid="c33">Feynman, 1985/2006</xref>, p. 10)</p>
</disp-quote>
Feynman&#8217;s view undercuts theoretical bias and has proved useful in theorizing about quantum phenomena. Perhaps it would also prove useful in theorizing about behavior dynamics.</p>
<p align="left">Twenty-five years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-2" rid="c59">Killeen (1988)</xref> commented on the state of theorizing about behavior dynamics:
<disp-quote>
<p align="left">If we look at the current renaissance of modeling &#8230; we see numerous creative accomplishments. But we do not have the sense that a system is being constructed. Fine points are debated while commonalities are ignored. When resolutions are attained, they are left to languish &#8230; to be resurrected ever less frequently in periodic reviews performed by graduate students to satisfy academic requirements. (p. 330)</p>
</disp-quote>
Twenty-five years later nothing has changed. In his article, Killeen went on to recommend constructing a system based on his behavior reserve theory. Another foundational candidate may be the evolutionary theory discussed in this article. Still other possibilities are <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-3" rid="c27">Dragoi &amp; Staddon&#8217;s (1999)</xref> cognitive expectancy theory, and <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-1" rid="c61">Killeen&#8217;s (1994)</xref> arousal theory. If prioritized sets of criterion data can be agreed upon, and if Feynman&#8217;s perspective on evaluating theories were to be adopted, then it ought to be possible to move forward, and ultimately arrive at a theory of behavior dynamics that is applicable to a wide range of behavioral phenomena and that can be widely accepted.</p>

<sec id="s38" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>The Selectionist Functioning of Living Systems</title>
<p align="left">One advantage of the evolutionary theory as a candidate theory is that it can be seen to be part of a simple, plausible, and appealing story about the general functioning of living systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr90-1" rid="c90">Pierce &amp; Cheney, 2013</xref>, Chapter 14). The overall operating principle in these systems is selection. Selection is responsible for organic evolution, may be responsible for behavioral evolution during the lifetimes of individual organisms, and may also be responsible for social and cultural evolution in species that live in groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-2" rid="c57">Hull, Langman, &amp; Glenn, 2001)</xref>. Hence, there may be a kind of fractal self-similarity in the mode of operation of living systems as the scale of analysis expands from the development of an individual, to the development of behavior, to the development of social and cultural practices. Needless to say, the details of how selection works at the various scales are likely to be different, but the idea that the same principle is operating as the scale changes is attractive, and adds to the appeal of the evolutionary approach. Indeed, adaptation driven by a selectionist mechanism may be seen as a defining characteristic of living systems, perhaps even as the defining characteristic, regardless of the scale at which the system&#8217;s operation is examined.</p>
