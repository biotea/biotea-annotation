<p align="left"><italic>Background:</italic> Suicide in older people is a significant public health issue with a predicted future increase. Contemporary research directs considerable attention toward physical, mental, and social risk factors that contribute to suicidality in older people; still, little is understood about the fundamental meanings that older people in suicidal crisis attribute to these factors. <italic>Aims:</italic> The aim of this qualitative study was to describe, analyze, and compare counselors&#8217; and older peoples&#8217; perceptions of the suicidal crisis during an emergency telephone conversation. <italic>Methods:</italic> Data collection consisted of individual interviews with telephone counselors (<italic>N</italic> = 7) working within an emergency mental health triage service, and listening to telephone calls (<italic>N</italic> = 14) received by the service responding to people aged 65 years and over in suicidal crisis. Triangulation of the two data sets resulted in the emergence of three key themes. <italic>Results:</italic> We found (1) congruence in the way risk factors were perceived by counselors and communicated during telephone conversations, (2) dissension between counselors&#8217; perceptions of end-of-life issues and older people&#8217;s feelings of ambivalence about wanting to die and not knowing what to do and (3) the need for working side-by-side with the older person, exploring acute changes and immediate capacity for change. <italic>Conclusions:</italic> An explicit focus on risk factors alone may preclude counselors from gaining a deeper understanding of suicidal crisis in an older person&#8217;s life. This research has begun to capture and illuminate how telephone counselors can deliver effective crisis intervention as older people struggle and make meaning through their suffering.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>

<p align="left">In line with international trends, Australia has an aging population and increased longevity has resulted in a larger proportion of the older population living to be 65&#160;years and over. At the same time, however, suicide in this age group has long been of concern to suicidologists and mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Erlangsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">Lapierre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr65-1" rid="c65">Shah, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr75-1" rid="c75">W&#230;rn, 2011</xref>). Given the changing demographics of societies around the world, it is argued that the absolute number of elderly suicides will continue to increase in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Conwell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-1" rid="c68">Tsoh et al., 2005</xref>). Significantly, older people have a higher risk of completed suicide than any other group worldwide, with approximately one in four attempts resulting in death (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Demir&#231;in, Akkoyun, Yilmaz, &amp; G&#246;kdogan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">Manthorpe &amp; Illiffe, 2010</xref>). Among older people a significant proportion often complete suicide on what is apparently their first attempt (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Manthorpe &amp; Illiffe, 2006</xref>). While suicide is not an illness or disease but a behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">De Leo, 2011</xref>), the strong association between suicide, attempted suicide, and mental illness makes early assessment, intervention, and care central components of effective suicide prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1" rid="c41">Mann et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Risk Factors</title>

<p align="left">On a global level, the rate of suicide is found to be highest among the elderly (Lapierre et al., 2011). In Australia, suicide rates reach a second peak after the 25&#8211;44-year age groups; in men aged over 85&#160;years. The highest age-specific death rate for males in 2009 was observed in the age group of 85&#160;years and over (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-1" rid="c64">Senate Community Affairs Reference Committee, 2010</xref>). Men aged 75&#160;years and over also remain a high-risk group (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">De Leo, Krysinska, Bertolote, Fleischmann, &amp; Wasserman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">De Leo &amp; Ormskerk, 1991</xref>). Contributing factors to older people&#8217;s suicide, cited within the research literature, include: loss of a partner or significant other (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-2" rid="c14">Demir&#231;in et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Fung &amp; Chan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-1" rid="c61">Rubenowitz, Waern, Wilhelmson, &amp; Allebeck, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-1" rid="c62">Rurup et al., 2011</xref>), economic dependency (Demir&#231;in et al., Manthorpe &amp; Illiffe, 2006), chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-2" rid="c42">Manthorpe &amp; Illiffe, 2006</xref>), social isolation and loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Cattell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-2" rid="c62">Rurup et al., 2011</xref>), and alcoholism (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-1" rid="c74">Waern, 2003</xref>). When compared with other population groups, suicide in older people is often characterized by fewer warning or explicit cues, less history of previous attempts, greater prevalence of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-2" rid="c5">Cattell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-2" rid="c21">Fung &amp; Chan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Harwood, Hawton, Hope, &amp; Jacoby, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Lebret, Perret-Vaille, Mulliez, Gerbaud, &amp; Jalenques, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-2" rid="c43">Manthorpe &amp; Illiffe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1" rid="c54">Pfaff &amp; Almeida, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-1" rid="c56">Pr&#233;ville, H&#233;bert, Boyer, Bravo, &amp; Seguin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-1" rid="c67">Snowdon, 2001</xref>), physical illness and functional impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-3" rid="c5">Cattell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Kj&#248;lseth, Ekeberg, &amp; Steihaug, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-2" rid="c38">Lebret et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-2" rid="c54">Pfaff &amp; Almeida, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-1" rid="c59">Quan, Arboleda-Florez, Fick, Stuart, &amp; Love, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-1" rid="c69">Turvey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr73-1" rid="c73">Waern et al., 2002</xref>), high levels of hopelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-2" rid="c34">Kj&#248;lseth et al., 2010</xref>), poor approaches to problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Gibbs et al., 2009</xref>), feeling as if one is a burden to others and family discord (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Duberstein et al., 2004</xref>), and an inability to open up to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Kj&#248;lseth, Ekeberg, &amp; Steihaug, 2009</xref>), including initiating contact with GPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-2" rid="c33">Kj&#248;lseth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-3" rid="c43">Manthorpe &amp; Illiffe, 2010</xref>) and mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Are&#225;n, Alvidrez, Barrera, Robinson, &amp; Hicks, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">George, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-1" rid="c52">Oxman, Dietrich, &amp; Schulberg, 2003</xref>) to seek help, although some studies show increased contact with GPs prior to suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-3" rid="c21">Fung &amp; Chan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">Luoma, Martin, &amp; Pearson, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>The Telephone as a Suicide Prevention Strategy for Older People</title>

<p align="left">Despite a wealth of research literature reporting on suicide prevention strategies across a broad demographic, there is still a paucity of studies and research data offering evidence-based, effective, and sustainable ways of preventing suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Krysinska &amp; De Leo, 2007</xref>), particularly where older people are concerned (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-2" rid="c18">Erlangsen et al., 2011</xref>). Traditionally, the telephone has been utilized as a valuable medium for crisis intervention and suicide prevention. Access to crisis telephone support and counseling is described as a &#8221;critical component of suicide prevention activity in Australia&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-2" rid="c64">Senate Community Reference Affairs Committee, 2010, p. 112</xref>). Encouragingly, studies of telephone services to assist those at risk of suicide (including older people) have emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">Atkinson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Gould, Kalafat, Harris-Munfakh, &amp; Kleinman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">Litman, Farberow, Shneidman, Heilig, &amp; Kramer, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Mishara &amp; Daigle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-1" rid="c49">Murphy, Wetzel, Swallow, &amp; McClure, 1969</xref>), as well as telephone services specifically tailored to the needs of older people, demonstrating positive and protective attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">De Leo, Carollo, &amp; Dello Buono, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">De Leo, Dello Buono, &amp; Dwyer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">Morrow-Howell, Becker-Kemppainen, &amp; Judy, 1998</xref>). Comparatively, however, in the studies conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-2" rid="c25">Gould et al. (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-2" rid="c39">Litman et al. (1965)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-2" rid="c45">Mishara and Daigle (1997)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-2" rid="c49">Murphy et al. (1969)</xref>, it is not possible to apply their findings specifically to the older people included in their samples. Furthermore, the telephone service researched by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-2" rid="c11">De Leo and colleagues (1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-2" rid="c12">2002</xref>) was not a suicide prevention service but a social and emotional support service for disabled older people, and they found benefit only in older women.</p>

<p align="left">At the same time debate has ensued as to whether these studies have been accompanied by a parallel development of research projects and methodology to evaluate their effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Dew, Bromet, Brent, &amp; Greenhouse, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1" rid="c46">Mishara et al., 2007</xref>). As Mishara and Weisstub question:
<disp-quote><p align="left">. . . to what extent are telephone helpers&#8217; beliefs based on their evaluations of the probability of an imminent attempt accurate? To date we have no empirical evidence to justify that telephone helpers are capable of predicting who will and who will not attempt suicide. (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1" rid="c47">Mishara &amp; Weisstub, 2010, p. 166</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
The above section raises the important question of what is meant by telephone helpers&#8217; &#8221;beliefs.&#8221; What do the beliefs pertain to in particular? The inference here it seems is to question telephone helpers&#8217; beliefs about the type and urgency of a particular response as they evaluate each call. </p>

<p align="left">Since older adults in suicidal crisis do utilize a range of telephone services, we need to know more about the key factors that significantly impact the understanding of counselors of the needs of suicidal older persons and about their abilities to address these needs.</p>

<p align="left">This requires a broader description and examination of key factors that significantly impact on the effectiveness of such services. In response, the aim of this qualitative study was to evaluate a metropolitan mental health triage (MHT) telephone service in Adelaide, South Australia. The major objectives of this evaluation were to:</p>

<title>Methodology</title>

<p align="left">Suicide in older people is succinctly characterized as a &#8221;complex and multifactorial phenomenon&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">O&#8217;Connell, Chin, Cunningham, &amp; Lawlor, 2004, p. 899</xref>). Thus, a qualitative approach was adopted, guided by principles of hermeneutical phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Kvale &amp; Brinkmann, 2009</xref>), primarily to focus on the meaning(s) suicidal behavior has for the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Hjelmeland &amp; Knizek, 2010</xref>). The deployment of phenomenology in this study contributed to the overall appreciation of the &#8221;lived experience of a group of individuals regarding a particular phenomenon&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Creswell, 1998, p. 51</xref>), allowing the researcher to understand something about the essence of the experience from both the counselor&#8217;s and the older person&#8217;s perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Esterman, Warland, &amp; Deuter, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, a qualitative approach facilitated an exploration of relationships between important risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-2" rid="c28">Hjelmeland &amp; Knizek, 2010, p. 77</xref>) rather than a purely objective measurement of these.</p>

In addition to following the standard conditions of the two HRECs, the research was guided by and conducted in accordance with the <italic>National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Australian Government, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Participant Selection and Recruitment</title>

<sec id="s8" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Interview Participants</title>

<p align="left">The study adopted a purposeful sampling framework targeting a group of employees who specifically work as telephone counselors (<italic>N</italic>= 7) inviting them to participate in the study. The motivation in taking a purposeful approach was to select information-rich cases from a targeted group for in-depth study (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1" rid="c53">Patton, 2002</xref>). Telephone counselors were drawn from an MHT telephone service located within the South Australian Ambulance Service (SAAS). The service is the primary contact point for any member of the public wishing to access mental health services. Between 2011 and 2012, the service received approximately 48,000 calls; a significant proportion of these calls were suicide related. Although people with mental illness make up only a small percentage of the total number of individuals receiving emergency services, the complexity of some cases can amplify the time taken, and the collaboration required by different agencies, to provide a service (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Government of South Australia, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p align="left">Recruitment was carried out through the MHT service, enlisting the assistance of a key contact person (the MHT Team Leader) to gain entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Glesne &amp; Peshkin, 1992</xref>). Posters were placed throughout the MHT telephone area and an e-mail invitation from the researcher was forwarded to all staff with a detailed information sheet attached. An honorarium in the form of an AUS $-50 gift voucher was given to each participant for their time. All participants signed a consent form before commencing the interview, and with their consent, the interviews were audio recorded.</p>

<sec id="s9" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Telephone Conversations</title>

<p align="left">Central to the organization&#8217;s mental health reporting system is a computerized database containing data on all noninpatient contacts with the mental health system. All calls are kept for 25 years. An initial database search was run by the Principal Advisor for Information Intelligence of MHT calls received by the service from people aged 65 and over. For the 12-month period from April 2010 to March 2011, the search uncovered a total of 178 clients. Twenty-one of these clients were triaged as <italic>Level A</italic>, a specific triage category meaning that the person concerned is considered likely to be a danger to themselves and/or others and must be assessed in person by a mental health professional as soon as possible (usually within 30&#8211;60 min in the community context). Many people receive an emergency community mental health response through Assessment and Crisis Intervention Service (ACIS) teams, which provide emergency assessment, intervention, and follow-up services. Other services that may be called upon include SAAS and the South Australian Police (SAPOL). In such instances, the counselor will notify the relevant emergency service(s) and attempt to keep the caller on the line until such services arrive.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>

<sec id="s11" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Individual Interviews With MHT Telephone Counselors</title>

<p align="left">Seven telephone counselors were recruited from the MHT service (<italic>n</italic> = 3 males; <italic>n</italic> = 4 females). The average age was 52.4 years. Four were qualified mental health nurses and three were mental health social workers. The service employs approximately 30 staff; 21 of these are employed full time. Prerequisites necessary for this role include (but are not limited to): proficiency in mental health assessment, including risk assessment; proficiency in screening for problematic use of alcohol and other drugs; effective communication and negotiation skills and willingness to engage in professional development, e.g., review recordings of calls received and participate in local quality improvement programs. The first phase of data collection involved conducting Critical Incident Technique (CIT) interviews with individual MHT telephone counselors. Developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Flanagan (1954)</xref>, this technique can facilitate an understanding of both the health professionals&#8217; role and the interactions between health professionals, patients, and other clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Byrne, 2001</xref>). One of the potential strengths of this approach is to encourage reflection on practice in a difficult emotional helping situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr60-1" rid="c60">Redpath, Stacey, Pugh, &amp; Holmes, 1997</xref>). The technique relies on gaining three important pieces of information: (1) the participants&#8217; complete and rich description of a situation or event to be explored, (2) the specific actions of the person/s involved in the event to aid understanding of why certain decisions were made, and (3) the outcome of the event to ascertain the effectiveness of the behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-1" rid="c63">Schluter, Seaton, &amp; Chaboyer, 2007</xref>). An interview questioning framework was developed, drawing on Flanagan&#8217;s work and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-2" rid="c63">Schluter and colleagues (2007)</xref>. Following an initial opening question asking, &#8221;What do you think are the broader issues for older people in suicidal crisis?&#8221; the interviewer then asked follow-up questions, seeking clarification and detail on topics relevant to the aims of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">Holstein &amp; Gubrium, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Listening to Telephone Conversations</title>

<p align="left">The second phase of data collection involved listening to audio recordings of 14 triage Level-A telephone calls from older adults over the preceding 12 months. An initial 21 calls were retrieved; however, six calls did not involve the older person in suicidal crisis, and were thus deemed irrelevant to the study. One call was irretrievable because of a corrupted audio file. This left a remaining 14 calls which are the subject of data analysis in this research (<xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-1" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Each client call lasted between 15 and 50 min with an average duration of 33 min and consisted of a series of smaller calls of varying duration that included separate conversations with a number of key informants. These included older people in suicidal crisis, their family members, spouses, and friends, and health professionals including ambulance officers, GPs, allied health staff, community nurses, and service providers. In order to gain an accurate understanding of the context surrounding each older person&#8217;s suicidal crisis, it was necessary to listen to each of the associated calls. Across the 14 client calls, there was an average series of three calls per client. Baseline data were collected on the older person&#8217;s age, gender, ethnicity, total length of the call series, key informants involved in the call series, marital status and residence, history of previous attempts, history of substance abuse, whether the person was intoxicated at the time of the call, indicated means of a current attempt, and risk factors indicated during the calls. While listening to each call, detailed written notes were made regarding the nature of the problem that led to the call and the recurring themes and subthemes emerging from the telephone conversations. These steps followed the framework used during the CIT interviews. <xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl1"/></p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>

<sec id="s14" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Analysis of CIT Interview Transcripts and Telephone Conversations</title>

<p align="left">As a method of qualitative data analysis, hermeneutical phenomenology seeks to capture and portray the &#8221;quality and texture&#8221; of the participants&#8217; experiences and explore their meanings and significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr76-1" rid="c76">Willig &amp; Billin, 2012, p. 117</xref>). Analysis took place alongside data collection, with the process of generating themes in hermeneutic phenomenology being less prescriptive than other qualitative approaches. Simply put, data analysis is derived from the researcher&#8217;s immediate and ongoing &#8221;dialogue with the text&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr71-1" rid="c71">van Manen, 1990</xref>). Analysis was performed through the processes of listening, reading, organizing, and writing, theorizing and re-reading to produce a detailed account of the recurrent findings. This gave rise to an analytical process supported by &#8221;holistic reading&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr71-2" rid="c71">van Manen, 1990</xref>), attending to each transcript as a whole and finding sentences or phrases that captured the fundamental meaning of the text as a whole. While transcribing the interviews, the research act incorporated highlighting the critical incidents with the most quality &#8211; that is, the most relevant and richly described incidents. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-2" rid="c20">Flanagan (1954)</xref>, analysis of critical incidents should be based on the number of incidents rather than the number of participants. A total of ten incidents from a possible 14 were included for analysis. Analysis of the written observations of the 14 telephone conversations was also conducted in the same way.</p>

<title>Results</title>

<p align="left">The central objective of this study was to identify key issues related to the provision of the MHT service to people aged 65 and over in suicidal crisis. Triangulation of the two datasets revealed three overarching themes. These themes (and their subthemes) are presented in the following section. </p>

<sec id="s17" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Theme 1: Risk Factors</title>

<sec id="s18" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Risk Factors for Older People in Suicidal Crisis as Perceived by MHT Counselors</title>

<p align="left">When asked, &#8221;What are the broader issues for older people in suicidal crisis?&#8221;, the MHT counselors talked about a range of risk factors including loneliness, hopelessness, powerlessness, sadness, grief, isolation, or reduced social connections due to lack of family contact or loss/death of a spouse. A range of physical and mental health problems were also present in their dialogue; in particular, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, depression, anxiety, cognitive problems, dementia, and senility. Complication with alcohol was also recalled. Other factors included deterioration in self-care and safety in the home. In summary, the counselors reflected on the importance of the overall <italic>capacity</italic> of the older person, in terms of their sense of resilience, the immediate support networks available to them, and how this impacted on their <italic>level of tolerance</italic> or ability to <italic>manage</italic> in a crisis.</p>

<sec id="s19" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Risk Factors as Communicated by Older People in Suicidal Crisis</title>

<p align="left">There was clear congruence between the MHT counselors&#8217; perceptions of risk factors for older people in suicidal crisis (outlined above) and those actually communicated during the telephone calls. Depression was mentioned frequently; however, it was often unclear whether depression in the older person had actually been diagnosed by a health professional. In the majority of telephone calls, it was significant others and/or health professionals who communicated information related to risk factors; older people rarely spoke of these. Rather, they used a range of descriptors to explain their current level of emotional pain. This was readily audible in their verbal descriptions such as &#8221;uphill battle,&#8221; &#8221;lost and alone,&#8221; &#8221;struggle&#8221; and also in nonverbal cues such as crying and vocal intonations of sadness, anger, and hopelessness. This finding was evident in all the conversations with older people.</p>

<title>Theme 2: Older People in Suicidal Crisis</title>

<sec id="s21" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>&#8221;They&#8217;re at the end of their life.&#8221;</title>

<p align="left">A recurring statement expressed by the MHT counselors was that the older person was &#8221;near&#8221; or &#8221;at the end part&#8221; or &#8221;point&#8221; of their lives; their &#8221;time had come.&#8221; This was not construed negatively; rather, there was a sense of resignation or acceptance of the fact that older people had already &#8221;lived their life.&#8221; However, the sum total of losses was much greater (when compared with a younger person in suicidal crisis), supports were fewer; therefore, there was now &#8221;little to hope for&#8221; or &#8221;little worth to live for.&#8221; That this was more likely to happen to an older person was less surprising to them. Some of the counselors acknowledged that similar assumptions are made about older people by others in society, including emergency services. It was also evident that the MHT counselors experienced tension and frustration in trying to manage what they described as older people&#8217;s &#8221;sadness&#8221; and &#8221;suffering&#8221;:

<disp-quote><p align="left">They&#8217;re near the end of their life. There&#8217;s little to hope for. Issues are ongoing. No end date. The reality that they are more at the end of their life.</p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">That [higher lethality] doesn&#8217;t really surprise me. . . . I suppose when you&#8217;re at that point in life, you say, &#8221;I&#8217;ve lived my life, I&#8217;ve had a good innings, but I&#8217;m not happy now, I&#8217;ve gotta deal with all these aches and ailments and I&#8217;d just rather be dead, thank you very much.&#8221;</p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">Unlike many of the younger callers . . . there&#8217;ll be another girlfriend, there&#8217;ll be another job, you will get well, the medical profession will find an answer for you.</p></disp-quote>

<sec id="s22" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Ambivalence About Dying</title>

<p align="left">During the telephone calls, older people expressed a strong sense of uncertainty or ambiguity about their intent to die. When asked direct questions, such as &#8221;Are you planning on committing suicide?&#8221;, the majority of older people expressed their intentions as &#8221;thinking about it.&#8221; This was also evident in the dialogue of significant others when asked to give their judgment of the level of suicidal intent in the older person, for example, when asked, &#8221;So what makes you think (he/she) is suicidal?&#8221; or &#8221;Did (he/she) say outright &#8211; I&#8217;m going to kill myself?&#8221; This is highlighted in the following key statements that were identified while listening to the telephone conversations:

<disp-quote><p align="left">I really think I&#8217;m going to kill myself today if nothing happens. (Older person)</p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">Not about &#8221;harm,&#8221; but (she&#8217;s) thinking of ways to die. (Daughter-in-law)</p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">I don&#8217;t want to go on anymore feeling like this. I&#8217;m not really planning it . . . but I&#8217;m thinking about it. (Older person)</p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">Counselor: So what are you going to do for the rest of the night?</p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">Older person: I don&#8217;t know. Probably kill myself.</p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">I want a reason [not] to take a bottle of pills to get some peace. I&#8217;m either gonna reach out or I&#8217;m dead. (Older person)</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec>

<sec id="s23" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>&#8221;I don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</title>

<p align="left">Older people and their significant others alike expressed ambiguity and uncertainty when asked what they were going to do now or what they were going to do next. Throughout the telephone conversations, the older people struggled to make decisions for themselves. Significant others also found it very difficult to make decisions on behalf of the older person:
<disp-quote><p align="left">Counselor: So what&#8217;s going to happen now?  </p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">Older person: I haven&#8217;t got a clue . . . I have . . . not . . . got . . . a . . . clue. </p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">I don&#8217;t know what I want to do . . . I feel . . . I feel . . . so down. I feel like the walls are closing in on me. (Older person)</p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">He said . . . &#8221;this is the last time I&#8217;m gonna ring yer . . . I&#8217;ve had enough. I don&#8217;t want to be here anymore.&#8221; . . . I don&#8217;t know what to do. (Ex-wife)</p></disp-quote>

<title>Theme 3: Approaches, Techniques, and Processes</title>

<sec id="s25" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Exploring Side-by-Side</title>

<p align="left">Triangulation of the two datasets revealed congruence between the MHT counselors&#8217; individual approach, techniques, and processes used with older people in suicidal crisis as communicated during the CIT interviews and with what was occurring in actual practice. A key subtheme was that of exploration, often referred to as &#8221;side-by-side&#8221; with the older person and/or their significant other. Problem solving was a process of active listening &#8211; in particular, the strategic and purposeful use of silence. In discussing their personal counseling style with older people, MHT counselors frequently used the terms &#8221;explore,&#8221; &#8221;validation,&#8221; &#8221;reassurance,&#8221; &#8221;understanding,&#8221; &#8221;real,&#8221; &#8221;normalizing statements,&#8221; &#8221;empathy,&#8221; and &#8221;curiosity&#8221;:


<disp-quote><p align="left">What I did (because I can&#8217;t do anything) was listened [sic]. </p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">Acknowledging that &#8221;that&#8217;s hard,&#8221; &#8221;that must be painful for you.&#8221;</p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">Yeah. And if people feel you&#8217;re really listening and you&#8217;re not brushing them off, and you&#8217;re not trying to fix it, but just want to explore it with them, side-by-side, they are . . . I think . . . they&#8217;re calm.</p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">So whilst we need information, it&#8217;s not about asking them questions. . . and being very . . . um . . . regimented about it. Nonconfronting (&#8221;let&#8217;s get to the point&#8221;), no rush, &#8221;look, you&#8217;ve rung; tell me how I can help you.&#8221; Often people will start telling you about the issue.

</p></sec>

<sec id="s26" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>What&#8217;s Different Now and How Can Things Change?</title>

<p align="left">An additional subtheme to emerge from triangulation of the two datasets was the MHT counselors&#8217; exploration of what was acutely different in the older person&#8217;s life at that very moment that had led to the older person calling, or a significant other or health professional to call on their behalf. Key statements drawn from the CIT interviews and actual questions posed during the telephone conversations are highlighted below:

<disp-quote><p align="left">I think you need to say what&#8217;s happening now, what is the person doing, why are you concerned about that?</p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">Tell me your day.</p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">So why would you (commit suicide) tonight? Why is it worse tonight? What&#8217;s different? Why is it so much harder for you today?</p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">What&#8217;s the one thing that&#8217;s happened? Can you tell me what&#8217;s been happening today?</p></disp-quote>

It was with this capacity for &#8221;immersion in the moment&#8221; that MHT counselors became more outcome oriented at particular points in the conversation to explore and determine the older person&#8217;s capabilities and possibilities for change:


<disp-quote><p align="left">Counselor: I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re still there. What are you doing? </p>

<p align="left">Older person: Sitting on the bed. </p>

<p align="left">Counselor: Have you taken any of those pills? </p>

<p align="left">Older person: No. </p>

<p align="left">Counselor: Is that the truth? </p>

<p align="left">Older person: Yep. </p>

<p align="left">Counselor: What are your thoughts now? Tell me what you&#8217;re thinking. </p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p align="left">I can hear your pain. I can hear your tears. But you&#8217;ve also called for help. And that&#8217;s what I want to do, I want to help you. (Counselor)</p></disp-quote>

<sec id="s27">
<title>Discussion and Recommendations</title>

<p align="left">It was not within the scope of this project nor of the ethics protocol to explore whether the older people present in the telephone conversations died from suicide after the telephone intervention. Thus the findings are specifically applicable to the distinct timeframe afforded within the telephone conversation. Here, some distinction between intervention and prevention is warranted. The goal of a suicide prevention service is often explicit in its title &#8211; it will attempt to prevent suicide among those individuals who make contact with it. By contrast, the relative &#8221;moral neutrality&#8221; of the suicide intervention model might be better able to attract and save the lives of individuals at highest risk of suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1" rid="c50">Nelson, 1984, p.&#160;1,332</xref>). For the intervention model, the key difference would lie in answering the question &#8221;what do I have to live for?&#8221; based on a comprehensive understanding of the individual&#8217;s extent and significance of loss, chronicity, social support, responsiveness to treatment, and other characteristics that impact upon their overall quality of life and capacity for improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-2" rid="c50">Nelson, 1984</xref>). This was evidenced in the approach to service provision by the MHT counselors under study. Plus, given the potential for feelings of ambivalence, crisis counseling may provide a life-supporting resource for a wide range of individuals, including older people.   </p>

<p align="left">Although it was clear within these conversations that the older people faced significant physical, mental, and social challenges (as shown in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-2" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), older people themselves rarely spoke of these. What they did express were intense feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loneliness, mirrored in <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-1" rid="c66">Shneidman&#8217;s (1996)</xref> concept of unbearable psychological pain from which he developed the term &#8221;psychache&#8221;:

<disp-quote><p align="left">The hurt, anguish, or ache that takes hold in the mind...the pain of excessively felt shame, guilt, fear, anxiety, loneliness, angst, dread of growing old or of dying badly. (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-2" rid="c66">Shneidman, 1996, p. 13</xref>)</p></disp-quote>

Thus for older people in suicidal crisis, the problem may center around their perception of and reaction (feelings) to the situations they described, and the subsequent impact on their identity, self-esteem, and quality of life.</p>

<p align="left">Although risk factors are relevant and important in identifying the needs of older people in suicidal crisis, and clinicians still need to continue to conduct risk assessments where appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-1" rid="c70">Undrill, 2007</xref>), an explicit focus on risk factors tends to position people as &#8221;passive objects of disease processes&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Illiffe &amp; Manthorpe, 2005</xref>). Such a focus (as opposed to one of offering hope and support) may place the counselors&#8217; relationship with the older person in jeopardy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-3" rid="c42">Manthorpe &amp; Illiffe, 2006, p. 27</xref>). Therefore, it may be more imperative that counselors investigate what these risk factors <italic>mean</italic> to the people experiencing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-3" rid="c28">Hjelmeland &amp; Knizek, 2010</xref>), particularly in the context of their immediate feelings of intense psychological pain.</p>

<p align="left">The second theme suggests that MHT counselors have limited knowledge of age-related issues and seem to feel overwhelmed by the &#8221;understandability&#8221; of the older persons&#8217; crises. Further education about these issues would be useful, especially how the MHT counselors&#8217; &#8221;empathy&#8221; with the concerns of the older person might cloud their judgment about what could be done to help. Furthermore, counselors&#8217; perceptions of older people as being near the end &#8221;point&#8221; or &#8221;part&#8221; of their life appeared at odds with older people&#8217;s feelings of ambivalence about wanting to die and not knowing what to do next. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-1" rid="c55">Pompili (2010, p. 241)</xref> argues that suicidal people <italic>are</italic>, in fact, ambivalent about death; they want both to live and to die. The task for clinicians then is to reach those vital components (such as hope, reasons for living or feeling useful) that might counterbalance death wishes. Counselors must avoid the rigid application of stereotyped assumptions about older people, specifically that growing old, illness, and the prospect of dying means there is a high lethality or suicidality orientation. For example, very few persons who are suffering from terminal and severely disabling chronic illnesses seriously consider or engage in behavior to end life prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1" rid="c44">Mishara, 1999</xref>). Such assumptions are also impacted by the dominant and broader ethos of health care systems worldwide; where avoiding death has become the &#8221;ultimate challenge&#8221; in the provision of contemporary healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-1" rid="c57">Price &amp; Cheek, 2007, p. 398</xref>), instead of improving the quality of life in old age. Thus, persons working in the field of suicide prevention are forced by the very nature of their craft to inhabit middle ground where principles (saving a life) and pragmatism (&#8221;there&#8217;s little to hope for in old age&#8221;) coalesce. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-2" rid="c47">Mishara and Weisstub (2010)</xref>, active debate is needed on this subject in order to unpack how essential or real the divergences are.</p>

<p align="left">Mental health triage involves difficult and complex decisions; ones which may have to be made at a time when the client is distressed, angry, or confused, and when the causes of behavior are unclear. An emergency response may have to be made very quickly, based on minimal information (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-1" rid="c72">Victorian Government Department of Health, 2010</xref>). Arguably, this may leave limited space for counselors to demonstrate &#8221;real care&#8221; for their suicidal fellows, not just to make the &#8221;appropriate&#8221; therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">De Leo, 2010, p. 138</xref>); therapy that is entirely guided by objective risk assessment. In short, &#8221;suicidal persons have to be convinced that their carers are actually caring for them.&#8221; This means that if this &#8221;credibility test&#8221; is not passed for whatsoever reason, the &#8221;care offered could be completely useless&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-2" rid="c8">De Leo, 2010, p. 138</xref>). Thus, empathy and genuine interest in the inner life of the person involved must be communicated during the telephone conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-1" rid="c58">Procter, 2007</xref>). </p>

<p align="left">It is also important to note that formulating an individual&#8217;s risk for suicide is best practiced through a highly collaborative process, whereby efforts to engage and intervene with the caller are often seamlessly interwoven throughout the worker&#8217;s assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Joiner et al., 2007, p. 361</xref>). Feedback from Australian consumers in relation to triage services shows that consumers want to feel listened to by a MHT counselor who is compassionate and who cares about improving their situation, emphasizing that the information, advice, and &#8221;listening&#8221; offered can be helpful in itself, and can aid in their recovery process (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-2" rid="c72">Victorian Government Department of Health, 2010, p. 8</xref>). In line with findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-3" rid="c25">Gould and colleagues (2007)</xref>, MHT counselors achieved this by &#8221;listening and letting the caller talk,&#8221; being &#8221;warm and caring,&#8221; providing &#8221;options for dealing with concerns,&#8221; being &#8221;available and patient,&#8221; helping the caller to &#8221;calm down&#8221; and &#8221;think clearly&#8221; by offering &#8221;new perspectives.&#8221; This created a framework for building rapport within which stories unfolded, feelings were received, and lives revealed. In this way, telephone triage is a practical task that helps make sense of personal distress and suffering.  </p>

<sec id="s28" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Limitations</title>

<p align="left">Several limitations should be acknowledged. Firstly, the telephone call sample included all triage Level-A calls for people aged 65 years and over in suicidal crisis. This overlooks the fact that there are three distinct generations encompassed within this age grouping, with their own unique set of physical, social, and mental health needs. Thus the analyses did not consider whether there were qualitative differences between older age cohorts included within the study: 65&#8211;74&#160;years (64% with an average age of 68&#160;years), 75&#8211;84&#160;years (7% with an average age of 79.5&#160;years), and 85&#160;years and over (28% with an average age of 88 years). Similarly, comparison of males (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and females (<italic>n</italic> = 4) was excluded from this study. Secondly, older callers of telephone crisis helplines are unlikely to be fully representative of older suicidal people in general, particularly as older people are less likely to volunteer their suicidal thoughts than younger people are and seek help for it. This was evidenced by a significantly lower proportion of self-referred calls from older people compared with the number of calls initiated by significant others and health professionals on their behalf.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>

<p align="left">While telephone services present a unique window of opportunity to assist older people in suicidal crisis, it is critical that those on the front line are adequately prepared and supported in order to effectively support older people needing assistance. Although risk factors are important indicators for diagnosis and treatment, an explicit focus on the objective measurement of these may preclude MHT counselors from gaining a deeper understanding of suicidal crisis in an older person&#8217;s life &#8211; one where intense psychological pain leads to thoughts of suicide, potentially manifesting in a decision to act. In response, this research has begun to capture and illuminate some of the deeper meaning structures underpinning such conversations. As <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr76-2" rid="c76">Willig and Billin (2012, p. 128)</xref> point out, &#8221;meaning in life at the end of one&#8217;s life can be as much about maintaining a connection with the world as it is about detaching from the world and one&#8217;s personal investment in it.&#8221; MHT counselors are well positioned to bridge this disconnect through critical reflection and action and by framing emergency responses in the context of the meanings that older people in suicidal crisis attribute to their lives.</p>
