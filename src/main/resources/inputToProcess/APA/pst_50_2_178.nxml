<p align="left">The supervisory relationship is one of the most important components in training therapists&#8217; professional development, and it is a frequent area of training-focused research. The current study explored how 57 training therapists&#8217; adult romantic attachments relate to the attachment to the supervisor and the supervisory working alliance. Additionally, we explored how both adult attachment and supervisory attachment relate to trainees&#8217; perceptions of their counseling self-efficacy (CSE). Results revealed that therapists with higher levels of fearful attachment to the supervisors and avoidant attachment in adult romantic relationships had less perceived CSE. Hierarchical regression revealed that it was the avoidant adult romantic attachment and the supervisory working alliance that accounted for the most significant variance in CSE, not the attachment to the supervisor. Path analysis using structural equation modeling was used to explore both the direct and indirect paths to CSE. When all variables were explored together, only the path from romantic attachment avoidance to fearful attachment to the supervisor was significant. Adult romantic attachment no longer directly related to CSE when including all the variables in the model. Implications of the findings will be discussed with regard to future research that is needed, the use of attachment-based supervisory interventions, and the application of the findings in clinical training.</p>

<p align="left">Researchers interested in the impact of training and professional development often look at the supervisory relationship to understand how trainees develop clinical competencies. For many trainees, the supervisory relationship constitutes a highly important portion of their training experience, as it is within this relationship that students learn to develop the clinical skills necessary to effectively treat their clients. Counseling self-efficacy (CSE) is the trainees&#8217; self-perceptions of efficacy with regard to their counseling skills, and it has been considered an important construct when investigating the impact of training on the professional development of clinical psychologists and counselors. Unfortunately, there has been little research exploring how the trainees&#8217; interpersonal styles, such as their attachments in adult relationships, influence their abilities to rely on supervision and benefit from the supervisory relationships. If these supervisory relationships are compromised and trainees are not able to trust their supervisors or expose their clinical vulnerabilities, young clinicians are less likely to increase their skills and develop more confidence over time. The current study aims to explore the relationship between trainees&#8217; adult attachment styles, their attachment to their supervisors, the supervisory alliance, and their perceptions of their clinical competencies. Before focusing specifically on how attachment relates to clinical supervision, it is important to review the basic tenets of attachment theory.</p>

<title>Attachment Theory and Applications to Supervision</title>
<sec id="s3" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Attachment Theory</title>
<p align="left">Bowlby and his contemporaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1" rid="c2">Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, &amp; Wall, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Bowlby, 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">1988</xref>) argue that interpersonal expectations in adult relationships develop based on repeated early interactions with caregivers. These patterns of relating with the caregiver evolve into internalized schemas, <italic>internal working models,</italic> of the self and of others that guide future interpersonal interactions. These internal working models form the foundation for the individual&#8217;s regulation of emotions, recollection of the past, and comfort with closeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-1" rid="c68">Kobak &amp; Sceery, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1" rid="c54">Schore, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-1" rid="c55">2001</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">More securely attached individuals perceive themselves as worthy of love and see others as both available and capable of being trusted (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-1" rid="c64">Bartholomew, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1" rid="c44">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007</xref>). They are more likely to develop successful, satisfying, and positive relationships with others than those who are insecurely attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-2" rid="c44">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007</xref>). Adults with more avoidant-fearful attachments, on the other hand, perceive themselves and others to be unlovable, inaccessible, and untrustworthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-2" rid="c64">Bartholomew, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-3" rid="c44">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007</xref>). These individuals with greater attachment avoidance tend to feel uncomfortable developing intimacy, closeness, or dependence on others. Unlike these more avoidant individuals, those with greater attachment anxiety tend to be highly sensitive to rejection, especially when they feel overwhelmed or distressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-4" rid="c44">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007</xref>). In addition to fearing rejection from others, more anxiously attached individuals tend to report more worries about separation and abandonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Fraley &amp; Shaver, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Researchers have shown that these internal working models have been found to influence relationships across the lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-1" rid="c57">Sroufe, Egeland, Carlson, &amp; Collins, 2005</xref>) and include relationships with romantic partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-1" rid="c69">Rholes &amp; Simpson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-1" rid="c56">Shaver, Hazan, &amp; Bradshaw, 1988</xref>), therapists (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Mallinckrodt, 2010</xref>), and even supervisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Bennett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Bennett &amp; Deal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-1" rid="c66">Gunn &amp; Pistole, 2012</xref>). It is important to note that not all adult relationships activate the attachment system (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-2" rid="c8">Bennett, 2008</xref>) and that not all supervisory relationships may activate attachment-based needs. It depends on the needs of the individual and the nature of the relationship. The psychotherapy and the supervisory relationships are unique in that therapists and supervisors often do act as secure bases for clients and training clinicians who are vulnerable and rely on the felt security of the other to manage emotions and grow as individuals.</p>

<sec id="s4" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Attachment and the Secure Base in Supervision</title>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-1" rid="c49">Pistole and Watkins (1995)</xref> were the first to describe the link between attachment theory and the supervisory relationship. They specifically addressed the importance of the supervisory attachment in training therapists because they believed that these novice therapists were more vulnerable and relied on their supervisors for the same type of secure base that clients seek in therapy and that adults seek from romantic partners. They argue that this felt security allows supervisees to be free to take risks in treatment, learn from their mistakes, develop their own therapeutic voice, and integrate a clear professional identity. The supervisor is available to the supervisee in times of uncertainty and when he or she is in need of support or emotion regulation. This is especially true of novice clinicians who often rely on their supervisors&#8217; guidance and assistance until their own skill development permits them to function more independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-2" rid="c10">Bennett &amp; Deal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-1" rid="c52">Riggs &amp; Bretz, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Supervisors often help beginning clinicians by managing overwhelming affects, facilitating their understanding of their countertransference reactions, assisting in the development of treatment recommendations, and mirroring their developing strengths and accomplishments. Similar to a romantic partner, therapist, or parent, the supervisor steps into the role of a caregiver and provides safety, empathy, feedback, and emotional support during times of need. Although there has been much written about the value of the supervision relationship, there has been less written about what can hinder the relationship and how the supervisees&#8217; attachment style can either foster or prevent the development of a secure relationship with the supervisor.</p>

<sec id="s5" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Attachment and the Supervisory Alliance</title>
<p align="left">The majority of research exploring the relationship between attachment and the supervisory relationship has focused primarily on the <italic>supervisory working alliance</italic>. As expected, results revealed that trainee secure attachment is a strong predictor of trainee satisfaction with supervision and positive perceptions of the supervisory relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-2" rid="c66">Gunn &amp; Pistole, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Kim &amp; Birk, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">Renfro-Michel and Sheperis (2009)</xref> found that trainees reported higher supervisory alliances when they had secure and avoidant-dismissing attachment styles compared with trainees who had avoidant-fearful or preoccupied styles. The findings support the link between supervisee attachment and their perception of the supervisory relationship, and they highlight the differences between avoidant-fearful and avoidant-dismissing supervisees. Although this research demonstrates how adult attachment relates to the <italic>alliance with the supervisor</italic>, the authors did not focus specifically on the attachment trainees develop with their specific supervisors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Adult Attachment and Attachment to the Supervisor</title>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Bennett, BrintzenhofeSzoc, Mohr, &amp; Saks (2008)</xref> studied these two distinct attachments, adult attachment and the <italic>specific attachment trainees develop with their supervisors</italic>, and they found that students with greater adult attachment avoidance were more likely to develop insecure attachment-related responses to their supervisors. In essence, they found that more attachment avoidance in outside adult relationships, the more avoidance in the <italic>supervisory attachments</italic>. They also explored which attachment (adult or supervisory) had the most significant relationship to the supervisory alliance, and they found that the attachment to the supervisor strongly predicted the supervisory alliance, whereas adult attachment style did not. This study is important because it sheds light on how adult attachment avoidance, but not anxiety, relates to the supervision relationship through the attachment to the supervisor, but that only the avoidance toward the supervisor related to the alliance.</p>
<p align="left">Although this study, combined with previous studies, facilitates our understanding of how the supervisory-specific attachment relates to the supervisory alliance and clarifies how attachment styles relate to perceptions of the supervision relationship, it does not address how attachments relate to other types of supervision outcomes such as trainees&#8217; perceptions of their clinical skills or their self-efficacy as clinicians. This is important, given one of the main objectives of clinical supervision is to facilitate trainees&#8217; sense of competence and efficacy with regard to their clinical work.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s7">
<title>Attachment and CSE</title>
<p align="left">CSE is a construct that measures the clinician&#8217;s belief in his or her ability to effectively serve as a counselor to a client in the near future (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Larson &amp; Daniels, 1998</xref>). Counselors with a more highly developed sense of CSE believe that they possess adequate skills needed to serve as counselors, whereas those with less CSE do not believe they are capable of performing this task effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Barnes, 2004</xref>). With regard to training psychologists, CSE is an important area of assessment because it addresses the confidence and perceived competency needed to serve as a psychotherapist for their clients.</p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Bradley and Olson (1980)</xref> established the relationship between trainees&#8217; perceived competencies and supervision. They found that the amount of supervision received during training was significantly related to the clinicians&#8217; ratings of clinical competencies, indicating the importance of supervision in the development of their professional identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-2" rid="c35">Larson &amp; Daniels, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Cashwell &amp; Dooley, 2001</xref>). CSE that is nurtured in supervision is related to clinicians&#8217; abilities to effectively counsel a client, counselor anxiety, counselor performance, and setting more realistic clinical goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-3" rid="c35">Larson &amp; Daniels, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Larson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1" rid="c50">Reese et al., 2009</xref>). These studies presented supervisory relationships as though they were all equal without exploring individual differences that impact the supervisory relationship. Few studies have explored how the clinicians&#8217; interpersonal histories, i.e., attachment styles, influence their alliance with the supervisor and their self-perceived clinical abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1" rid="c22">Deal, Bennett, Mohr, &amp; Hwang, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-2" rid="c22">Deal et al. (2011)</xref> were the first to study trainee attachment patterns as they related to self-reported clinical competencies and how they relate to a supervisory intervention geared at fostering the supervisory alliance. After the intervention, they found that trainees with more anxious attachments increased their clinical autonomy from the supervisors more quickly compared with more avoidant supervisees. The authors suggest that the attachment anxiety may have facilitated their use of the supervision. Unlike more anxious supervisees, more avoidant trainees were slower to develop autonomy, and they resisted asking for help. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-3" rid="c22">Deal et al. (2011)</xref> argue that these trainees, the more avoidant ones, are the most at risk because they can look independent on the outside while secretly needing more help with their clients.</p>
<p align="left">Although this study demonstrates a relationship between adult attachment and the use of supervision to gain self-perceived clinical competencies, the study did not explore the influence of the attachment specific to the supervisor. The studies to date have explored the relationship between adult attachment and either supervisory alliance or CSE in separate studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-2" rid="c9">Bennett et al. (2008)</xref> focused on the link between adult attachment, supervisory attachment, and the alliance. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-4" rid="c22">Deal et al. (2011)</xref> focused on adult attachment and clinical competencies. Studies have yet to explore the relationships among all of these variables to tease apart which attachments relate to the supervision relationship and which relate to their perceptions of their clinical skills. The current study will explore how adult romantic attachment style and specific attachment to the supervisor are directly and indirectly related to the perceptions of CSE in novice clinicians.</p>

<title>Current Hypotheses</title>
<p align="left">1. We plan to replicate the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-3" rid="c9">Bennett et al. (2008)</xref>, using the same measure of adult attachment (Experiences in Close Relationships Scale [ECR-S]) and different measures of supervisory attachment. We predict that novice clinicians&#8217; adult romantic attachment avoidance (the nonsupervisory attachment) will relate to their attachments to their supervisors. The more the adult attachment avoidance, the less secure the attachment to the supervisor, the more fearful the attachment to the supervisor, and the less preoccupied to the supervisor. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-4" rid="c9">Bennett et al. (2008)</xref>, we expect that general attachment anxiety will not relate to the supervisory attachment.</p>
<p align="left">2. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-5" rid="c22">Deal et al. (2011)</xref>, we predict that novice clinicians&#8217; adult romantic attachment will relate to CSE. Specifically, we expect a negative correlation between adult attachment anxiety and CSE and adult attachment avoidance and CSE.</p>
<p align="left">3. We expect to replicate <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-5" rid="c9">Bennett et al.&#8217;s (2008)</xref> findings and predict that novice clinicians&#8217; specific attachment to their supervisors will relate to the supervisory alliance using different measures of supervisory attachment and alliance. Specifically, we predict that secure attachment to the supervisor will positively correlate to alliance, whereas fearful and preoccupied attachment to the supervisor will negatively correlate to alliance. In addition to predicting a relationship between the supervisory attachment and alliance, we predict that secure attachment will positively correlate to CSE, whereas fearful and preoccupied attachment to the supervisor will negatively correlate to CSE.</p>
<p align="left">4. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-6" rid="c22">Deal et al. (2011)</xref> found that adult attachment related to self-reported competencies, we predict that novice clinicians&#8217; attachment to their supervisors will account for the most variance in the prediction of CSE, above and beyond adult romantic attachment anxiety and avoidance. The supervisory relationship should be most related to counseling skills compared with adult romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-2" rid="c16">Bradley &amp; Olson, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-2" rid="c20">Cashwell &amp; Dooley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-4" rid="c35">Larson &amp; Daniels, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-2" rid="c36">Larson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-2" rid="c50">Reese et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">5. We predict that there may be direct and indirect paths to CSE. Using path analysis, we plan to explore how adult romantic attachment relates to CSE directly and indirectly through its relationship to the supervisory relationship. Even though adult romantic attachment may not directly relate to the supervisory alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-6" rid="c9">Bennett et al., 2008</xref>), it is likely to relate to the supervisory attachment that has been linked to the alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-7" rid="c9">Bennett et al., 2008</xref>). Based on previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-5" rid="c35">Larson &amp; Daniels, 1998</xref>), we know the supervisory alliance is likely related to perceptions of CSE. If this is the case, attachment avoidance may directly and indirectly, through the supervisory attachment and alliance, influence CSE.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p align="left">Data were collected from two different cohorts of students during two academic years from a graduate psychology training program located in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. In 2010, 27 therapists participated and in 2011, 30 therapists participated, none of whom participated in the previous cohort. Forty-six (80%) were female and 11 (20%) were male. Of these 57 therapists, 3 (5.3%) were African American, 2 (3.5%) were Asian American, 49 (86%) were Caucasian, 2 (3.5%) indicated &#8220;other,&#8221; and 1 (1.8%) did not respond to the question. The average age in this sample was 27 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.20). Thirty-two (47%) indicated having no previous psychotherapy experience, whereas 24 (53%) indicated having some previous clinical experience. When asked to rate their theoretical orientation on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high), the mean for therapists&#8217; ratings of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was 2.9 (<italic>SD</italic> = .86), Psychodynamic Psychotherapy was 4.1 (<italic>SD</italic> = .73), and Humanistic Psychotherapy was 2.8 (<italic>SD</italic> = .95). All therapists attended weekly supervision with a licensed clinician who supervised their treatment of adult therapy clients. None of the participating supervisees completed measures on the same therapist in this study, so there were no nested data.</p>

<title>The Working Alliance Inventory&#8211;Short Form</title>
<p align="left">As in previous research studies examining attachment in supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-8" rid="c9">Bennett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-7" rid="c22">Deal et al., 2011</xref>), the items on the Working Alliance Inventory&#8211;Short Form (WAI-S; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-1" rid="c59">Tracey &amp; Kokotovic, 1989</xref>) were reworded and used to measure the quality of the working alliance between the student clinicians and their supervisors. This short form is based on the original Working Alliance Inventory composed of 36 items (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Horvath &amp; Greenberg, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">1989</xref>), and contains three subscales (four items each) measuring client&#8211;therapist agreement on goals, agreement on tasks, and bond. A number of studies have provided support for the WAI-S, and most recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Busseri and Tyler (2003)</xref> have supported the interchangeability of the short and original forms for the client version and for the total and subscale scores. Items assessing agreement of goals include &#8220;My supervisor and I are working toward mutually agreed upon goals,&#8221; items assessing the task include &#8220;I believe the way we work with the patients is correct,&#8221; and items assessing the bond include &#8220;I believe my supervisor likes me.&#8221; The alpha coefficients were estimated to be .93 for the client&#8217;s and .87 for the counselor&#8217;s version by Cronbach&#8217;s (1951) procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-2" rid="c31">Horvath &amp; Greenberg, 1989</xref>).

The ECR-S is a 36-item measure of attachment style that asks respondents to agree or disagree on a 7-point scale with items tapping attachment anxiety (e.g., &#8220;I worry about being abandoned,&#8221; &#8220;I worry that romantic partners will not care about me as much as I care about them&#8221;) and avoidance (e.g., &#8220;I prefer not to show a partner how I feel deep down,&#8221; &#8220;I am very comfortable being close to romantic partners&#8221; [reverse scored]). The construct validity of these scales in relation to predictions derived from attachment theory has been established in scores of studies (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-5" rid="c44">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-2" rid="c17">Brennan et al.

<title>The Therapist Attachment to Supervisor Scale</title>
<p align="left">After reviewing the literature for a measure on supervisory attachment without success and noting that current researchers exploring supervisory attachment indicated that there was &#8220;no attachment-based supervision measure&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-3" rid="c66">Gunn &amp; Pistole, 2012</xref>, p. 231), we decided to modify the 36-item Client Attachment to Therapist Scale (CATS; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">Mallinckrodt, Gantt, &amp; Coble, 1995</xref>) and reword items to reflect the specific attachment therapists have with their supervisors. In previous research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-9" rid="c9">Bennett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-4" rid="c66">Gunn &amp; Pistole, 2012</xref>), the ECR-S was revised to assess the supervisory attachment, but we believed that we were already using the ECR-S in the current study to assess adult attachment and the results could be influenced by the similarities of the items. In addition, the CATS, unlike the ECR-S, taps into more clinically related behaviors such as sharing feelings (item 12), having expectations from session to session (item 17), and the supervisor comforting the supervisee when upset (item 29). Using the revised CATS (what we term the TAS in this study), supervisees received a continuous score for secure, preoccupied, and fearful attachment patterns with their supervisors. Example items include, &#8220;My supervisor isn&#8217;t giving me enough attention&#8221; (indicating a more preoccupied attachment to the supervisor), &#8220;I feel humiliated in my supervision sessions&#8221; (indicating a more fearful attachment to the supervisor), and &#8220;I can tell that my supervisor enjoys working with me&#8221; (indicating a more secure attachment to the supervisor).</p>
<p align="left">Because we used the attachment to therapist measures (CATS) and changed items to assess attachment to supervisor (TAS), we followed the procedure used by <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-5" rid="c66">Gunn and Pistole (2012)</xref>, who modified the ECR-S to reflect the relationship with the supervisor. To determine the validity of the measure, they ran a principal axis factor analysis with promax rotation and pairwise deletion of random missing data. We did the same and sought a three-factor solution to correspond to the CATS&#8217; Secure, Fearful, and Preoccupied subscales. The result explained 49.12% of the variance, with Factor 1 (Secure) explaining 32.81% of the variance, Factor 2 (Fearful) explaining 10.00%, and Factor 3 (Preoccupied) explaining 6.32% of the variance. When looking at the items, they corresponded with the items on the TAS, with Factor 1 being Secure (items reflecting the supervisee could trust and depend on the supervisor), Factor 2 Fearful (Concerned with being shamed or humiliated in supervision), and Factor 3 Preoccupied (wanting more time and outside contact with supervisor). The alpha coefficients for internal consistency of the original CATS were .64 for secure attachment, .63 for avoidant-fearful attachment, and .81 for preoccupied-merger attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-2" rid="c39">Mallinckrodt et al., 1995</xref>). In the present study, Cronbach alphas were.73 for secure, .77 for avoidant-fearful, and .72 for preoccupied-merger.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p align="left">In 2010 and 2011, members of the research team identified all student therapists in their second year of practicum who had been in at least 3 months of supervision. In 2010, 33 students were eligible to participate but only 27 consented (82%). In 2011, 32 students were eligible to participate but only 30 consented (94%). During clinic disposition meetings, participants completed the informed consent, followed by a packet of questionnaires. Participants were told that their responses were confidential and that neither supervisors, nor faculty, nor clinic staff would see their responses. The questionnaires included the ECR-S, TAS, WAI, and COSE-S. The TAS AND WAI-S were altered to reflect the relationship with &#8220;your current individual psychotherapy supervisor who has the most impact on your current clinical work with adult clients.&#8221;</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p align="left">After the study was completed, we asked seven experienced clinicians/researchers in the field of attachment and psychotherapy to review the items on the TAS to determine if the overall items were reflective of the supervisory attachment. The experts were asked to determine if any items were problematic or did not apply to an experience a supervisee could endorse. Five of the seven experts revealed that item 4 was not likely to be descriptive of attachment in supervision. This item states &#8220;I yearn to be one with my supervisor&#8221; and reflects a preoccupied attachment to the supervisor. Two of seven indicated that item 7 was not likely to be descriptive of supervision. This item states &#8220;I wish my supervisor could be with me on a daily basis&#8221; and also reflects a preoccupied attachment to the supervisor. Only one of seven indicated that item 25 was problematic. This item states &#8220;I wish I could do something for my supervisor too&#8221; and again reflects a preoccupied attachment to the supervisor. Besides these four items, all of which reflect a preoccupied attachment, the experts stated that they believed the remaining items reflected feelings/reactions a supervisee could easily experience when working with a supervisor, and all of the experts believed strongly that a supervisee could develop a strong attachment to a supervisor. Based on this feedback and the statistical analysis, we felt the use of the TAS secure and fearful subscales was most valid.</p>
<p align="left">Means and correlations for variables are found in <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-1" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Our first set of hypotheses examined the bivariate correlations between novice clinicians&#8217; adult romantic attachments (the nonsupervisory attachment) and their attachments to their supervisors. We predicted that the more the adult attachment avoidance, the less secure the attachment to the supervisor, the more fearful the attachment to the supervisor, and the less preoccupied to the supervisor. We found one positive significant correlation between adult attachment avoidance and fearful attachment to the supervisor, (<italic>r</italic> = .33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Besides that significant relationship, adult attachment anxiety and avoidance did not significantly correlate with supervisory attachment dimensions.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl1"/></p>
<p align="left">Our second set of hypotheses focused on the relationship between adult romantic attachment and CSE. We expected a negative relationship between adult romantic attachment anxiety and avoidance and CSE. We found partial support for this hypothesis. Only adult attachment avoidance was negatively correlated with CSE (<italic>r</italic> = &#8722;.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). As predicted, we found that supervisees who endorsed higher levels of attachment avoidance reported lower CSE. Adult attachment anxiety, on the other hand, was not significantly correlated with CSE.</p>
<p align="left">Third, we expected that attachment to the supervisor would relate to both the supervisory alliance and CSE. Specifically, we predicted that secure attachment would positively correlate to alliance, whereas fearful and preoccupied attachment to the supervisor would negatively correlate to alliance. We found partial support for this hypothesis. As expected, we found a strong positive correlation between secure supervisory attachment and the alliance (<italic>p</italic> = .83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and we found a strong negative correlation between fearful attachment to the supervisor and the alliance (<italic>p</italic> = &#8722;.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). We did not find a significant correlation between the preoccupied attachment to the supervisor and the alliance. We also predicted that secure attachment would be positively related to CSE, whereas more fearful and preoccupied attachment to the supervisor would be negatively related to CSE. Again we found partial support for our hypothesis. As predicted, the more fearful attachment to the supervisor was negatively correlated with CSE (<italic>r</italic> = &#8722;.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Although the correlation between CSE and secure attachment to the supervisor was positive, it only approached significance (<italic>r</italic> = .24, <italic>p</italic> = .09), and preoccupied attachment to the supervisor was not at all correlated with CSE.</p>
<p align="left">W<bold>e</bold> predicted that attachment to the supervisor would account for the most variance in the prediction of CSE, above and beyond adult attachment anxiety and avoidance and the supervisory relationship. This is based on research that trainees&#8217; supervisory relationships would be related to their perceptions of their counseling skills (Larson et al., 2008). In current study, we ran one hierarchical regression with adult romantic attachment anxiety and avoidance entered in the first step, working alliance entered second, and secure, preoccupied, and avoidant attachment to the supervisor entered third. By entering the supervisory attachment last, we sought to test whether the supervisory attachment predicts CSE above and beyond the variance accounted for by adult romantic attachment and the supervisory alliance.</p>
<p align="left">To ensure the model was accurate, we also tested for multicollinearity by assessing the variance inflation factors (VIFs), the reciprocal of tolerance, which measures how much the variance estimated coefficients are increased if there is no correlation among the predictor variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">O&#8217;Brien, 2007</xref>). We believed this was important, given the significant correlation between the supervisory alliance and supervisory attachment. If no predictor variables were correlated, then all the VIFs would equal 1. If a VIF is equal to or greater than 5, there is increased collinearity associated with that variable. VIFs in our study were all &lt;5, except for secure supervisory attachment. This was not surprising because secure supervisory attachment was highly correlated with supervisor working alliance (<italic>r</italic> = .83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000). Based on the VIF exceeding 5, we deleted secure supervisory attachment from the regressions and reran the analysis. After removing dimension of secure supervisory attachment, the VIFs were all &lt;5, indicating multicollinearity is not likely to negatively influence the validity of the regressions, and VIFs are reported within <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-1" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl2"/></p>
<p align="left">The results of the hierarchical regression (<xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-2" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) revealed that adult romantic attachment, the first step of the regression, accounted for a significant amount of variance in CSE, as indicated by the significance of attachment avoidance in step 1 (<italic>p</italic> = .01). Attachment anxiety was not significant. The second step of the regression, which included the supervisory alliance, also accounted for a significant amount of variance in the prediction of CSE, above and beyond adult romantic attachment anxiety and avoidance. The last step of the regression was not significant, indicating that preoccupied and fearful attachment to the supervisor did not contribute to any significant variance in the prediction of CSE, above and beyond adult romantic attachment and alliance.</p>
<p align="left">The possibility of multiple paths to CSE (both direct and indirect) was the fourth hypothesis of this study. Path analysis was used to explore how adult romantic attachment relates to CSE directly and indirectly through its relationship to the supervisory relationship. The small sample size in the study limited the analyses performed. Two path models were developed to determine if adding fearful attachment to the supervisor and supervisory alliance would influence the relationship between adult romantic attachment avoidance and CSE. A larger sample size would have permitted the inclusion of the supervisory attachment dimensions in the path model. Despite the significant limitation of sample size, it was felt that path analysis would add to the understanding of the direct and indirect effects of adult romantic and supervisory attachment on CSE. Theoretically, adult attachment avoidance was expected to relate to fearful attachment to the supervisor, and fearful attachment to the supervisor was expected to relate to the supervisory alliance and CSE. The results of the path model supported a direct relationship between supervisory attachment and adult romantic attachment but did not support our hypotheses with respect to indirect effects, that is, both Avoidance to CSE through Fearful Supervision (test statistic = 0.407 and <italic>p</italic> = .684) and Avoidance on CSE through WAI (test statistic = &#8722;8.99 and <italic>p</italic> = .369) indirect effects were not significant. AMOS, version 7.0, was used to test the path models and calculate the path coefficients using the maximum likelihood estimation option (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Arbuckle, 2006</xref>). Missing data were handled appropriately using the default option in AMOS v7.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-2" rid="c3">Arbuckle, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Path analyses are historically one component of the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach, which has been deemed a more powerful analysis of causal paths. This is due to the fact that SEM takes into consideration, errors in measurement among the observed variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Maruyama, 1998</xref>). In SEM models, observed variables are represented by rectangles (&#8220;task,&#8221; &#8220;bond,&#8221; &#8220;goal,&#8221; &#8220;fearful attachment to supervisor,&#8221; &#8220;attachment avoidance,&#8221; &#8220;attachment anxiety,&#8221; and &#8220;CSE&#8221;), whereas latent variables are represented by ellipses (i.e., WAI). The lines with one-headed arrows depict the direction of predicted relationships, whereas the two-headed arrows depict covariances.</p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-1" rid="c58">Thompson (2004)</xref> recommends that SEM models be tested using the overall fit measures of chi-square (&#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the comparative fit index (CFI). The chi-square statistic (&#967;<sup location="post">2</sup>) is used to test the difference between the predicted and observed relationships. Typically, a statistically nonsignificant &#967;<sup location="post">2</sup> is desired (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). CFI index values can range from 0 to 1, and values equal to .95 or greater are typically deemed acceptable. An RMSEA of .06 or less indicates a good fit, and an RMSEA of .08 to .10 indicates moderate fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">Loehlin, 2004</xref>). In the case of Model 2, chi-square results were nonsignificant (&#967;<sup location="post">2</sup> = 9.781, <italic>df</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), CFI = .991, and RMSEA = .063, which certainly indicates good overall model fit.</p>

As expected, the measured variables, &#8220;task,&#8221; &#8220;bond,&#8221; and &#8220;goal,&#8221; load significantly onto the latent variable, WAI. Additionally, the standardized path loading from romantic adult attachment Avoidance to Fearful Supervision was significant. The path loadings from WAI to CSE and Avoidance to CSE also approached significance (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc3-2" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) When supervisory alliance and fearful attachment to the supervisor are added to the model, the relationship between adult attachment avoidance and CSE is no longer significant; however, adult attachment avoidance does significantly relate to fearful attachment to the supervisor. According to <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc2-2" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the correlation between E1 and E6 (equivalently, the correlation between represents the relation between fearful attachment to the supervisor and supervisory alliance) is negative (&#8722;.78) and statistically significant at the alpha level of .05 (<italic>p</italic> = .012).<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig1 fig2"/><xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl3"/></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p align="left">As we hypothesized, attachment orientations, both within and outside the supervision relationship, relate to the supervisory alliance and trainees&#8217; perceptions of CSE. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-10" rid="c9">Bennett et al. (2008)</xref>, we found that fearful avoidance in supervision, but not avoidance in romantic adult relationships, significantly correlated to the supervisory alliance. In essence, the fearful attachment that developed with the supervisor related most with the supervisory alliance (the task, bond, and goals of supervision). The supervisees&#8217; ratings of avoidance and anxiety in outside relationships were not correlated to the alliance that developed with the supervisor, but the avoidance in outside relationships was related to the fearful attachment in supervision.</p>
<p align="left">When accounting for variance in perceptions of CSE, we found that adult attachment avoidance and alliance, but not the supervisory attachment as expected, accounted for the most variance in CSE. This partly supports <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-8" rid="c22">Deal et al.&#8217;s (2011)</xref> findings that general adult attachment (anxiety and avoidance) is related to perceptions of clinical competency. We did not find the expected relationship between anxious adult attachment and CSE. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-9" rid="c22">Deal et al. (2011)</xref> found that more anxious supervisees rated themselves as less self-aware, more dependent, and less motivated compared with the average student. In addition, more anxious students were perceived as more clingy and needy by the supervisors. We expected that this would translate to less CSE in our study because more anxious individuals tend to be more critical of their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-10" rid="c22">Deal et al., 2011</xref>), but we did not find this to be the case. It appears that when rating one&#8217;s professional skills and clinical abilities, it was the attachment avoidance in outside relationships and the perceptions of the current alliance with the supervisor that were most related. Despite the moderate correlation between attachment avoidance and fearful attachment to the supervisor, they were different with regard to how each of them related to CSE.</p>
<p align="left">When we looked more closely at the path analysis, we saw that adult attachment avoidance was no longer related to CSE when the other variables were included in the second model. In the second path model, adult attachment avoidance significantly related to the fearful attachment to the supervisor, and the fearful attachment to the supervisor related to the alliance. The path between the alliance in supervision and CSE only approached significance.</p>
<p align="left">Although the path models in our study do not indicate indirect paths to CSE, future research is needed to determine if indirect paths to CSE do exist. The small sample size limits the power of the path analysis and it is important for future studies to continue to explore these relationships. Even with our small sample, we did find that the avoidant attachment significantly related to the fearful attachment to the supervisor, that the path from the fearful attachment to the alliance approached significance, and that the path between alliance and CSE also approached significance. In essence, adult attachment avoidance may have an indirect relationship to CSE through the fearful attachment to the supervisor and the working supervisory alliance. These relationships need to be studied in a larger sample to truly understand how they influence one another.</p>
<sec id="s19" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p align="left">Although we found significant findings that facilitate our understanding of how attachment relates to supervision and encourage future studies, there were limitations. One of the limitations is not knowing for certain if the moderate to high correlations between fearful and secure attachment to the supervisor and the supervisor alliance (correlations ranging from .67 to .83, respectively) are due to the overlapping nature of the constructs or are distinct, yet related, constructs.</p>
<p align="left">To explore both possibilities, we looked at the findings in other studies to see if our correlations were consistent. We also relied on statistical analyses to determine multicollinearity and explored the individual items on the measures to determine the overlap. When reviewing previous studies, we found that we are not the first to find high correlations between attachment security in supervision and the alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-6" rid="c66">Gunn &amp; Pistole, 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-7" rid="c66">Gunn and Pistole (2012)</xref>, using a different measure of supervisory attachment (ECR-S), found that trainee supervisor attachment security accounted for 74% of the variance in the alliance and was a strong positive predictor of rapport and perceptions of supervisor support.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, we found comparable correlations between the subscales of the TAS and supervisory alliance as <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-3" rid="c39">Mallinckrodt et al. (1995)</xref> using the CATS to assess client attachment and alliance in therapy. We found the same high correlations between secure attachment to the supervisor and the alliance, less significant correlations between fearful attachment and the alliance, and not at all significant correlations between preoccupied attachment and alliance. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-4" rid="c39">Mallinckrodt et al. (1995)</xref> argued that &#8220;The low correlations between CATS subscales, and different patterns of association with other measures, suggest that the subscales measure distinct aspects of clients&#8217; attachment relationship to their therapists. Because shared variance with the WAI was relatively low for the second and third CATS subscales, and lower than the variance shared by the WAI subscales with one another, findings suggest that these CATS subscales measure an aspect of the counseling relationship distinct from the working alliance.&#8221; (p. 315).</p>
<p align="left">The assessment of multicollinearity in the regression analysis revealed that the secure subscale overlapped significantly with alliance. Secure attachment to the supervisor appears to be more overlapping with the alliance compared with the fearful attachment. Fearful attachment to the supervisor, on the other hand, did not represent a problem in the regression with regard to multicollinearity. In addition, if we look more closely at the items of the alliance measure, none of the items on the supervisory alliance measure tap into the experience of shame, disapproval, and humiliation in the relationship that are the hallmark of a fearful attachment. The items on the TAS included &#8220;I think my supervisor disapproves of me,&#8221; &#8220;I feel humiliated in my supervision sessions,&#8221; &#8220;I suspect my supervisor probably isn&#8217;t honest with me,&#8221; and &#8220;It&#8217;s hard for me to trust my supervisor.&#8221; These items all reflect a perception that the supervisor is withholding and is not experienced as a secure base in which the supervisee can be open and vulnerable. Items on the alliance measure tap into the overall bond and liking for one another in the relationship, the ability to work on goals together, and the agreement on the task of supervision. The items are tapping into different aspects of the supervision relationship. It is not surprising that the fearful attachment to the supervisor and the alliance are significantly correlated based on theory and the results of previous studies. There is a large literature linking attachment avoidance in relationships, including couples and groups, to poor alliance and/or lower ratings of relationship satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr65-1" rid="c65">Diener &amp; Monroe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-1" rid="c67">Illing, Tasca, Balfour, &amp; Bissada, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-6" rid="c44">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">Another limitation is a result of the lack of a validated measure of the supervisory attachment. All of the studies exploring the attachment to the supervisor apply another measure of attachment to the supervision relationship. This leaves us with the possibility that the items on the measure used, in our study the TAS, are based on the context of a relationship that does not fit as neatly within the context of supervision. This is most true for the preoccupied subscale of the TAS. Despite the acceptable alpha coefficients for the subscale, at least five of the seven expert raters had a problem with at least one of the items in the subscale.</p>
<p align="left">Although future studies need to explore the preoccupied subscale, seven expert clinicians indicated that almost all of the other items on the TAS reflected the supervisory experience. The alpha coefficients were strong for the attachment dimensions, the correlations were in the expected directions for the secure and fearful attachment subscales, and the significant relationships between fearful attachment to the supervisor and self-perceptions of clinical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-11" rid="c22">Deal et al., 2011</xref>) and the supervisory alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-11" rid="c9">Bennett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-8" rid="c66">Gunn &amp; Pistole, 2012</xref>) were similar to the findings of previous studies that relied on completely different measures of supervisory attachment. Having similar findings across studies using different measures of attachment avoidance in supervision strengthens the usefulness of the findings.</p>
<p align="left">Although our sample included two consecutive cohorts of training therapists that took 2 years to collect, the sample is still considered small and likely limited the statistical power of our analyses. This likely reduced the ability to detect significant paths within the SEM. Additionally, the correlational nature of the analyses limits our ability to elucidate potentially causal relationships among attachment styles, the supervisory relationship, and CSE. We are also not able to determine the direction of the relationships in this study. Given that attachment style is largely established before becoming a graduate student, it is important for future researchers to study how trainees&#8217; personal attachment patterns lead to the attachment to the supervisor and CSE.</p>
<p align="left">Furthermore, we only explored therapists&#8217; ratings of the supervision and CSE. As a result, the supervisors&#8217; perceptions of the quality of the relationship were not available for more detailed analysis, nor could we compare the trainees&#8217; perceptions of CSE with those of the supervisor.</p>

<title>Facilitating the Secure Base in Supervision: Practice Implications of the Findings</title>
<p align="left">One of the most important questions raised by our findings is how can supervisors facilitate security when working with fearful or more avoidant supervisees, supervisees who may be more at risk of developing a fearful attachment to the supervisor. This is especially important given that attachment avoidance not only impacts supervision, but it also influences psychotherapy and the supervisees work with their clients. Avoidance in the therapist has been related to less empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1" rid="c53">Rubino, Barker, Roth, &amp; Fearon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-1" rid="c62">Westmaas &amp; Silver, 2001</xref>), more emotional distancing (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2005</xref>), hostile countertransference in dyads with anxious clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Mohr, Gelso, &amp; Hill, 2005</xref>), and rejecting interpersonal behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Bartholomew &amp; Horowitz, 1991</xref>). Supervisors may be in the best position to help these more avoidant novice clinicians understand how their own internal representations of self and others, representations that relate to automatic affect regulating mechanisms, influence both supervision and clinical work with patients.</p>
<p align="left">A case study on attachment style and the supervision relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1" rid="c47">Neswald-McCalip, 2001</xref>) explored the extent to which secure, anxious-resistant, and anxious-avoidant supervisee attachment styles impacted supervisees&#8217; ability to maximally benefit from supervision. They focused on the importance of the supervisors&#8217; ability to respond to the supervisee, and they found that a secure supervisor who is consistently, appropriately available to supervisees may, over time, mitigate the impact of supervisees&#8217; personal insecure attachments on their work with their patients. The study also found that when trainees who are anxious-avoidant are paired with supervisors who defy their negative expectations, by being available when their supervisees require assistance, they begin to modify their attachment relationships based on the new secure relationship with the supervisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-2" rid="c47">Neswald-McCalip, 2001</xref>). There is hope for trainees who come to supervision with insecure attachment styles. A secure relationship in supervision, like a secure relationship in therapy, contributes to improved attachment security for supervisees both in their supervisory and outside relationships.</p>
<p align="left">Likewise, our findings show how trainees&#8217; attachment styles can relate to their relationships with not only their patients but also their supervisors. The consistency with which avoidant-fearful attachment in trainees was related to lower perceptions of CSE indicates that these individuals may require specific interventions by their supervisors to more effectively facilitate their clinical work and professional development.</p>
<p align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-12" rid="c22">Deal et al. (2011)</xref> developed an attachment-based intervention to teach field instructors about the impact of their supervisees&#8217; attachment styles. The intervention itself was partially effective because the supervisors who participated in the training reported greater supervisory alliances compared with those who were in the control condition. Because more avoidant supervisees are more self-sufficient, less willing to acknowledge their own limitations, and more inclined to avoid emotional or vulnerable material in the supervision sessions (Bennett et al., 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-13" rid="c22">Deal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-9" rid="c66">Gunn &amp; Pistole, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-3" rid="c47">Neswald-McCalip, 2001</xref>), it is even more important that the supervisor learn how to assess the supervisees&#8217; attachments by watching the videos of the sessions and paying attention to the supervisory relationship. Such a supervisor would not only watch videotapes of therapy sessions, but she would also process reactions in the here-and-now of the supervision, and pay attention to nonverbal signs of withdrawal and ruptures by looking at eye contact, posture, missed sessions, and lateness (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-14" rid="c22">Deal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr60-1" rid="c60">Wallin, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">It is likely that more avoidant supervisees will indirectly express how they are feeling, and the supervisor will need to try and find a way to bring this back to the supervision to help the supervisee explore what is truly happening in the relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-10" rid="c66">Gunn and Pistole (2012)</xref> found that more secure attachment within the supervisory relationship facilitated rapport and disclosure in supervision.</p>

<title>Future Research Implications</title>
<p align="left">Although we have focused all of our attention on the insecurely attached supervisee, we are not ignorant to the fact that the supervisors&#8217; attachment styles equally influence the supervision process. We already know that the alliance in supervision is stronger when therapists perceived their supervisors as having more secure attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-2" rid="c52">Riggs &amp; Bretz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-1" rid="c63">White &amp; Queener, 2003</xref>). We also know that supervisors&#8217; anxiety predicted lower trainee professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Foster, Heinen, Lichtenberg, &amp; Gomez, 2006</xref>). What we do not know is how the supervisors&#8217; attachment interacts with the trainees&#8217; attachment styles. We need a clearer understanding of how supervisors&#8217; attachments interact with supervisees&#8217; attachments so we can determine how supervision can hinder trainee development as well as facilitate it. Just as an avoidant therapist is less likely to empathize or engage with certain patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-2" rid="c53">Rubino et al., 2000</xref>), an avoidant supervisor is likely to do the same in supervision. We have yet to explore the mutual influence of attachment in supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-3" rid="c10">Bennett &amp; Deal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-15" rid="c22">Deal et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p align="left">This study furthers our understanding of attachment in supervision by exploring general attachments outside of supervision, the supervisory attachment, the alliance in supervision, and perceptions of clinical self-efficacy. We found that higher trainee supervisor attachment security was related to higher supervisory alliance ratings but was not significantly related to CSE. Higher fearful attachment in supervision, on the other hand, was related to both less supervisory alliance and less CSE. Adult romantic attachment, outside of the supervisory relationship, was not at all related to the supervisory alliance, but it was related to CSE. The regression analysis revealed that only attachment avoidance in adult romantic relationships and the supervisory alliance accounted for significant variance in CSE. Fearful attachment to the supervisor did not account for significant variance in CSE, despite being significantly correlated to CSE. The path model demonstrated that these relationships may be even more complex. In the first model, we found that adult attachment avoidance clearly related to CSE, but when all of the other variables were entered into the second model, the path between attachment avoidance and CSE was no longer significant. The only path that was significant was the one between attachment avoidance and fearful attachment to the supervisor. The path between fearful attachment and the alliance was significant, and the path between alliance and CSE approached significance. These findings are important and indicate the need for future research that teases apart how fearful attachment and the alliance influence self-perceptions of clinical competency. We found support for attachment theory and replicated results from previous studies using different measures of supervisory attachment. Our findings support the relevance of future research that explores attachment in supervision.</p>
